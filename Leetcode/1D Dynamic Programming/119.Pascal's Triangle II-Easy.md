## Question:

Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.  

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:  

Example 1:  

Input: rowIndex = 3  
Output: [1,3,3,1]  

Example 2:  

Input: rowIndex = 0  
Output: [1]  

Example 3:  
 
Input: rowIndex = 1  
Output: [1,1]  
 
Constraints:  

0 <= rowIndex <= 33  
 
Follow up: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(rowIndex) extra space?

## Thought:
We use 1d dp to do it.

This Java code computes the rowIndex-th row of Pascal's Triangle using an iterative approach:  

Design and Logic  

Initialization:  
The method starts by initializing a list result with a single element 1, representing the first row of Pascal's Triangle.  

Building the Row:  
The code uses a loop to build each row from the first up to the rowIndex-th row.  
For each iteration, it starts a new list newRow initialized with 1 to represent the first element of the current row.  
It then fills in the values between the first and last elements by iterating through the previous row (result) and summing up adjacent entries to form the new row.  

Finalizing the Row:  
After filling in the values between the first and last elements, 1 is added to the end of newRow to complete the row.  
The result list is then updated to reference the newRow for the next iteration or final result.  

Output:  
After completing the loop, the result now holds the rowIndex-th row of Pascal's Triangle, which is returned as the output.  

Summary  
This solution efficiently builds each row based on the previous row without needing to construct the entire triangle, thereby optimizing memory usage and computational effort. It iteratively updates the list to hold the next row, making it a space-efficient method for obtaining a specific row in Pascal's Triangle.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(1);

        for(int i = 0; i < rowIndex; i++){
            List<Integer> newRow = new ArrayList<>();
            newRow.add(1);
            for(int j = 1; j < result.size(); j++){
                newRow.add(result.get(j - 1) + result.get(j));
            }
            newRow.add(1);
            result = newRow;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(n)
