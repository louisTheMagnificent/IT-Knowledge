## Question:

Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.  

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]   
Output: true  

Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]  
Output: true  

Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".  

Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.  

Example 3:  

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]  
Output: false  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 300  
1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000  
1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20  
s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.  
All the strings of wordDict are unique.

## Thought: 
We use 1d dp to do it.  

This Java method wordBreak checks whether a given string s can be segmented into a sequence of one or more dictionary words from a given list wordDict using a dynamic programming approach:  

Initialization:  
A boolean DP array dp of size s.length() + 1 is initialized, where dp[j] indicates whether the substring s[0..j-1] can be segmented into words from the dictionary.  
dp[0] is set to true to represent that an empty string can always be segmented.  

Dynamic Programming Calculation:  
The outer loop iterates through the string s from 1 to s.length(), aiming to determine the segmentability of each prefix ending at j.  
The inner loop iterates through each word in wordDict. For each word, it checks if:  
The length of the word does not exceed j (ensuring the word can potentially fit into the current substring of s).  
The substring ending at j and having the length of the word matches the word itself.  
The remaining prefix (up to the start of this word) can be segmented, indicated by dp[j - str.length()]. 
If both conditions are met, dp[j] is set to true, and further checking for this position is stopped by breaking out of the inner loop.  

Result:  
The method returns the value of dp[s.length()], which tells whether the entire string s can be segmented into words from the dictionary.  

This method effectively checks each substring of s against the words in wordDict, building up a solution that determines if the string can be entirely broken down into valid dictionary words.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[s.length() + 1];

        dp[0] = true;

        for(int j = 1; j <= s.length(); j++){
            for(int i = 0; i < wordDict.size(); i++){
                String str = wordDict.get(i);
                if(j >= str.length()){
                    if(dp[j]) break;
                    dp[j] = dp[j - str.length()] && str.equals(s.substring(j - str.length(), j));
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[s.length()];
    }
}
```
