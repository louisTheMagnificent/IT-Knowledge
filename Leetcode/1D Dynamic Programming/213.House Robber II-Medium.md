## Question:

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.  

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [2,3,2]  
Output: 3  

Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]  
Output: 4  

Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).  
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.  

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3]  
Output: 3  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 100  
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

## Thought:
We use 1d dp to do it.

This Java code defines a solution to the "House Robber" problem using dynamic programming. It calculates the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without robbing two adjacent houses. The solution includes the following steps:  

Base Cases:  
If there's only one house, the method returns the value of that house (nums[0]).  
If there are two houses, the method returns the maximum of the two values (Math.max(nums[0], nums[1])).  

Main Logic:  
The method uses a helper function subRob to calculate the maximum amount that can be robbed over a specified range of the array. It considers two scenarios:  
Robbing from the first house to the penultimate house (subRob(nums, 0, nums.length - 1)).  
Robbing from the second house to the last house (subRob(nums, 1, nums.length)).  
The main function then returns the maximum value obtained from these two scenarios.  

Helper Function subRob:  
Initializes two variables, x and y, where x represents the maximum rob amount up to the previous house and y represents the maximum rob amount up to the current house.  
Iterates through the specified range of the array, updating x and y to hold the maximum amounts that can be robbed up to each house without robbing two adjacent houses.  
The loop uses a dynamic programming approach to update the maximum amounts based on whether including the current house's money provides a better total than skipping it.  

The approach optimizes the rob strategy by considering overlapping subproblems (i.e., adjacent houses) and utilizing previously computed results to build up the final answer. This efficiently solves the problem with a time complexity linear to the number of houses.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 1) return nums[0];
        else if(nums.length == 2) return Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        else return Math.max(subRob(nums, 0, nums.length - 1), subRob(nums, 1, nums.length));
    }

    public int subRob(int[] nums, int start, int end){
        int x = nums[start];
        int y = Math.max(nums[start + 1], x);
        for(int i = start + 2; i < end; i++){
            int curr = Math.max(x + nums[i], y);
            x = y;
            y = curr;
        }

        return y;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
