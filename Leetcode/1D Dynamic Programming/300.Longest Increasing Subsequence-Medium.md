## Question:

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]  
Output: 4  

Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]  
Output: 4  

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]  
Output: 1  

Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 2500  
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104  
 
Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time complexity?

## Thought 1:
We use 1d dp to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to the "Longest Increasing Subsequence" (LIS) problem using dynamic programming. The goal is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given array where the elements are in increasing order:  

Initialization:  
An array dp of the same length as nums is initialized, where each element is set to 1. This is because the minimum length of an increasing subsequence that includes each element is 1 (the element itself).  
A variable result is initialized to 1 to track the maximum length of any increasing subsequence found.  

Dynamic Programming Solution:  
The outer loop iterates through the array nums starting from the second element (i=1 to nums.length - 1), considering each element as a potential end of an increasing subsequence.  
The inner loop iterates from the start of the array to the current element i, checking all possible preceding elements (j=0 to i-1).  
If nums[j] is less than nums[i], it indicates that the element at j can be part of an increasing subsequence ending at i. The dp[i] is updated to the maximum of its current value or dp[j] + 1 (extending the subsequence ending at j with the current element i).  
After evaluating all possible j for each i, result is updated to the maximum value in dp[i].  

Returning the Result:  
After filling the dp array, the result variable contains the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array, which is returned as the output.  

This method effectively calculates the LIS by building up the solution using the subproblems of finding the longest subsequence up to each index, thus allowing the overall problem to be solved efficiently in O(n^2) time complexity due to the nested loops.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        int result = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++){
                int temp = 1;
                if(nums[j] < nums[i]){
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
            result = Math.max(result, dp[i]);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use binary search to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to find the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) in an array nums using a combination of dynamic programming and binary search:  

Initialization:  
A List<Integer> named result is initialized to dynamically store the smallest possible tail values for all potential increasing subsequences.  

Iterative Process:   
The code iterates through each number in the nums array.  
For each number, it checks if it can be appended to extend the current longest subsequence (i.e., if it's greater than the last element of result).  
If it can't be appended (meaning it does not extend the largest subsequence):  
It uses a binary search to find the position where this number could replace an existing value in result to maintain the smallest possible values while preserving the length of subsequences. This step ensures the potential for forming a longer subsequence in subsequent iterations.  

Binary Search:  
A helper method binarySearch is implemented to find the appropriate index in result to replace with num.  
The binary search ensures that the replacement operation is done efficiently, maintaining the overall runtime complexity lower than a straightforward dynamic programming approach.  

Output:   
The size of the result list at the end of the iteration represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence, as each element in result corresponds to the smallest possible tail of subsequences of increasing lengths.  

This approach optimally keeps track of the LIS using the properties of patience sorting, where each element in the result list represents the end of a potential LIS up to that length. The use of binary search allows the solution to run in O(nlogn) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(result.isEmpty() || nums[i] > result.get(result.size() - 1)){
                result.add(nums[i]);
            }
            else{
                int index = binarySearch(result, nums[i]);
                result.set(index, nums[i]);
            }
        }
        return result.size();
    }

    public int binarySearch(List<Integer> result, int num){
        int left = 0;
        int right = result.size() - 1;
        while(left <= right){
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if(result.get(mid) == num) return mid;
            else if(result.get(mid) > num) right = mid - 1;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }

        return left;
    }
}
```
