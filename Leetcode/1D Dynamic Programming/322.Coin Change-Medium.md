## Question:

You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.  

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.  

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.  

Example 1:  

Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11  
Output: 3  

Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1  

Example 2:  

Input: coins = [2], amount = 3  
Output: -1  

Example 3:  

Input: coins = [1], amount = 0  
Output: 0  

Constraints:  

1 <= coins.length <= 12  
1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1  
0 <= amount <= 104

## Thought:
We use 1d dp to do it.  

This Java method coinChange calculates the minimum number of coins required to make up a given amount from a set of coin denominations using a dynamic programming approach:  

Initialization:  
A DP array dp is initialized with amount + 1 entries where dp[i] represents the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount i.  
dp[0] is set to 0 because no coins are needed to make up an amount of 0.  
All other entries of dp are initially set to Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2 to represent a large value (used to avoid overflow and to signify that the amount initially can't be made with the given coins).  

Filling the DP Table:  
The outer loop iterates through all amounts from 1 to amount.  
The inner loop iterates through each coin in the coins array.  
If the current amount i is at least as large as the coin coins[j], it updates dp[i] by considering using one more of that coin (dp[i - coins[j]] + 1) and takes the minimum of the current value and this new possible value.  

Result:  
If dp[amount] still holds the initial large value (Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2), it means the amount cannot be made up with the given coins, and the method returns -1.  
Otherwise, it returns the value of dp[amount], which represents the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount.  

This solution leverages dynamic programming to build up solutions to smaller subproblems, efficiently determining the minimum number of coins needed for increasing amounts up to the target amount.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount){
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= amount; i++){
            dp[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2;
        }

        for(int i = 1; i <= amount; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < coins.length; j++){
                if(i >= coins[j]){
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coins[j]] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[amount] == Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2 ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
}
```
