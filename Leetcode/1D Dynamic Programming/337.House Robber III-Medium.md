## Question:

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.  

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.  

Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.  

Example 1:  

Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]  
Output: 7  

Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]  
Output: 9  

Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.  

Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].  
0 <= Node.val <= 104

## Thought:
We use 1d dp to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to the "House Robber III" problem, where the goal is to maximize the amount of money robbed from a binary tree structure of houses without robbing two directly connected houses. The approach uses dynamic programming combined with recursion:  

Recursive Function (backtrack):  
The function is designed to traverse the tree and calculate the maximum money that can be robbed at each node considering two scenarios: robbing the current node or not robbing it.  
It returns an array of two integers for each node:  
The first element (result[0]) represents the maximum amount that can be robbed from the subtree rooted at this node without robbing this node.  
The second element (result[1]) represents the maximum amount that can be robbed from the subtree including the money from this node.  

Base Case:  
If the current node is null, the function returns an array {0, 0}, indicating that no money can be robbed from an empty subtree.  

Recursive Exploration:  
For each node, the function recursively calls itself for the left and right children to get the maximum rob-able amounts from both subtrees (dpLeft and dpRight).  

Calculations:  
result[0] is calculated as the sum of the maximum of robbing or not robbing each child. This ensures that the current node is not robbed, but the best results from its children are used.  
result[1] (when the current node is robbed) is the sum of the values from not robbing both children (dpLeft[0] + dpRight[0]) plus the value of the current node (root.val).  

Final Decision in Main Function (rob):  
The main function rob calls the backtrack for the root and then returns the maximum of robbing or not robbing the root node (Math.max(result[1], result[0])).  

This solution efficiently computes the optimal robbery plan using a postorder traversal of the tree, where each node's decision is informed by the optimal decisions of its children, ensuring a globally optimal solution without violating the adjacency constraint.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int rob(TreeNode root) {
        int[] result = backtrack(root);
        return Math.max(result[1], result[0]);
    }

    public int[] backtrack(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null) return(new int[2]);

        int[] dpLeft = backtrack(root.left);
        int[] dpRight = backtrack(root.right);

        int[] result = new int[2];

        result[0] = Math.max(dpLeft[1], dpLeft[0]) + Math.max(dpRight[1], dpRight[0]);

        int robCurr = dpLeft[0] + dpRight[0] + root.val;

        result[1] = robCurr;

        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(Height of the tree)
