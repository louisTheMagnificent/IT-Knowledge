## Question:

Given an integer n, break it into the sum of k positive integers, where k >= 2, and maximize the product of those integers.  

Return the maximum product you can get.  

Example 1:  

Input: n = 2  
Output: 1  

Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 10  
Output: 36  

Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.  
 
Constraints:  

2 <= n <= 58

## Thought:
We use 1d dp to do it.

This Java code defines a method integerBreak in the Solution class that finds the maximum product of integers that sum up to n. It utilizes dynamic programming for efficient computation. The method initializes an array dp where dp[i] represents the maximum product obtainable from integers that sum up to i. The base cases are set for dp[0], dp[1], and dp[2].  

For each number from 3 to n, the code iterates through possible splits of the number i into two parts, j and i-j. The maximum product is computed either by directly multiplying these two parts or by using one part and the optimal product of the other part as previously computed in dp. The final result, dp[n], is the maximum product for the input number n.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int integerBreak(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 0;
        dp[2] = 1;
        for(int i = 3; i <= n; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= i - j; j++){
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], Math.max(j * (i - j), j * dp[i - j]));
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
