## Question:

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.  

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.  

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.  

Example 1:  

Input: m = 3, n = 7  
Output: 28  

Example 2:  

Input: m = 3, n = 2  
Output: 3  

Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:  
1. Right -> Down -> Down  
2. Down -> Down -> Right  
3. Down -> Right -> Down  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= m, n <= 100

## Thought 1:
This Java code calculates the number of unique paths in an m x n grid by using combinatorial mathematics rather than dynamic programming. It determines the number of ways to arrange m-1 downward moves and n-1 rightward moves within a total of m+n-2 moves using the combination formula 
C(n,k). Here's a brief outline of its approach:  
Early Return: If either m or n is 1, the function returns 1 since only one path is possible.  
Combinatorial Calculation: The solution computes the number of combinations by selecting the smaller of m-1 or n-1 from m+n-2. This is implemented using an iterative multiplication and division to calculate the result directly, avoiding the need for factorial calculations.  
Return Result: The result is computed using long to avoid overflow and then cast to int before being returned.  

This method is efficient, avoiding the memory overhead of dynamic programming by directly computing the required combinations.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        long total = m + n - 2;
        if (m == 1 || n == 1)
            return 1;

        long result = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= Math.min(m - 1, n - 1); i++) {
            result = result * total / i;
            total--;
        }

        return (int) result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(Min(m,n))

## Thought 2:
We use 1d dp to do it.

This Java code implements a dynamic programming solution to compute the number of unique paths in an m x n grid, where movement is restricted to rightward and downward moves. Here's a brief explanation of the approach:  

Dynamic Programming Table Initialization:  
A 2D array dp is initialized with dimensions m and n to store the number of paths to each cell.  

Base Cases Handling:  
For cells in the first row (i == 0) and the first column (j == 0), the number of paths is set to 1 because there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or column, either by moving right from the leftmost cells or down from the topmost cells.  

Fill the DP Table:  
For other cells (i, j), the number of paths to reach cell (i, j) is the sum of the paths to reach the cell directly above it (i-1, j) and the cell to its left (i, j-1), i.e., dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]. This relation leverages the substructure property of dynamic programming.  

Return Result:  
The value in the bottom-right corner of the grid, dp[m-1][n-1], gives the total number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.  

This solution efficiently computes the result using an iterative approach and a 2D DP table to store intermediate results, ensuring that each cell's path count is built from previously solved subproblems.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if(i == 0 || j == 0) dp[i][j] = 1;
                else dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }

        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
}
```
