## Question:

You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.  

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.  

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.  

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.  

Example 1:  

Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]  
Output: 2  

Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.  
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:  
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down  
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

Example 2:  

Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]  
Output: 1  

Constraints:  

m == obstacleGrid.length  
n == obstacleGrid[i].length  
1 <= m, n <= 100  
obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.

## Thought:
We use 1d dp to do it.

This Java code solves the problem of finding the number of unique paths in a grid that includes obstacles, using dynamic programming. Here's a concise breakdown of the approach:  

Initialization:  
The method initializes a 2D array dp of the same size as obstacleGrid to store the number of paths to reach each cell.  
If the starting cell (0,0) does not contain an obstacle (i.e., obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0), it is initialized with dp[0][0] = 1.  

First Row and First Column:  
For the first row and the first column, the number of paths is set based on the presence of obstacles:  
If a cell in the first row/column has an obstacle, it is set to 0 since no path can cross an obstacle.  
Otherwise, each cell in the first row inherits the value from its left neighbor, and each cell in the first column inherits from its top neighbor, as long as there are no obstacles.  

Dynamic Programming Formula:  
For other cells not in the first row or column, the number of paths to cell (i, j) is computed as the sum of the paths to the cell directly above it (i-1, j) and the cell to its left (i, j-1), unless there's an obstacle at (i, j) which would make dp[i][j] = 0.  

Final Result:  
The result, which is the number of unique paths to the bottom-right corner of the grid, is stored in dp[m - 1][n - 1] and returned.  

This method effectively handles grids with obstacles by dynamically building up the number of ways to navigate through the grid while avoiding blocked paths.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length, n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        if(obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0) dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
            if(obstacleGrid[0][i] == 1) dp[0][i] = 0;
            else dp[0][i] = dp[0][i - 1];
        }

        for(int i = 1; i < m; i++){
            if(obstacleGrid[i][0] == 1) dp[i][0] = 0;
            else dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0];
        }

        for(int i = 1; i < m; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j < n; j++){
                if(obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1) dp[i][j] = 0;
                else dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }

        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
}
```
