## Question: 

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be strictly increasing.  

A continuous increasing subsequence is defined by two indices l and r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]  
Output: 3  

Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.  
Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element 4.

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]  
Output: 1  

Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly increasing.  

Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 104  
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Thought 1:
We use 1d dp to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to find the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (LCIS) in an array nums using dynamic programming:  

Initialization:  
An array dp of the same length as nums is initialized where each element is set to 1. This is because the minimum length of any increasing subsequence that includes at least one element is 1.  
A variable result is initialized to 1 to keep track of the maximum length of LCIS found during the process.  

Dynamic Programming Fill:  
The code iterates through the array starting from the second element.  
For each element at index i, if nums[i] is greater than nums[i - 1], it indicates a continuation of an increasing sequence. Therefore, dp[i] is updated to dp[i - 1] + 1, which extends the length of the subsequence by 1 from the previous element.  
After updating dp[i], the result is updated to the maximum of the current result and dp[i] to ensure it holds the maximum length found so far.  

Return the Result:  
After completing the loop through all elements, the result variable, which now contains the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence, is returned.  

This approach effectively tracks the length of increasing subsequences through the array, updating the record of the longest as it progresses, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        int result = 1;
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i] > nums[i - 1]){
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;
            }
            result = Math.max(result, dp[i]);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)

## Thought 2:
We use 1d dp to do it but constant space complexity.

This Java code efficiently solves the problem of finding the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (LCIS) in an array nums using a space-optimized dynamic programming approach:  

Initialization:  
An integer dp is initialized to 1, which represents the length of the current continuous increasing subsequence.  
An integer result is also initialized to 1 to track the maximum length of any LCIS found during the traversal of the array.  

Iterative Process:  
The code iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1).  
For each element at index i, it checks if nums[i] is greater than nums[i - 1] (the previous element):  
If true, it increments dp by 1 because the current element extends the increasing sequence.  
If false, it resets dp to 1 because the sequence has been broken, and a new increasing sequence starts from this element.  
After evaluating dp for the current element, result is updated to be the maximum of the current result and dp. This ensures that result always holds the maximum length of LCIS found so far.    

Returning the Result:  
The function returns result, which contains the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence by the end of the array.  

This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, and a space complexity of O(1) since it only uses two integer variables to track the lengths. This method is optimal for large datasets where space efficiency is crucial.

        int dp = 1;
        int result = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i] > nums[i - 1]){
                dp++;
            }
            else{
                dp = 1;
            }
            result = Math.max(result, dp);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
