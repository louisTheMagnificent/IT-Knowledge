## Question:

You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.  

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.  

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.  

Example 1:  

Input: cost = [10,15,20]  
Output: 15  

Explanation: You will start at index 1.  
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.  
The total cost is 15.

Example 2:  

Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]  
Output: 6  

Explanation: You will start at index 0.  
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.  
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.  
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.  
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.  
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.  
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.  
The total cost is 6.  
 
Constraints:  

2 <= cost.length <= 1000  
0 <= cost[i] <= 999

## Thought:
We use 1d dp to do it.  

This Java code solves the problem of finding the minimum cost to reach the top of a staircase where each step has a given cost associated with it. The solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the approach:  

Dynamic Programming Array Initialization:  
The code initializes a dp array where dp[i] represents the minimum cost to reach step i. The size of the dp array is one more than the cost array to account for reaching the top step, which is beyond the last step in the cost array.  
dp[0] and dp[1] are set to 0 since you can start at step 0 or step 1 without any cost.  

Fill DP Array:  
The code iterates through the dp array starting from index 2 (the third step) up to the length of the cost array plus one.  
For each step i, the code calculates the minimum cost of reaching that step by comparing the cost of taking one step from i-1 and the cost of taking two steps from i-2, and adds the respective cost[i-1] or cost[i-2] to those values. The minimum of these two values is stored in dp[i].  

Calculate Final Result:  
The value at dp[cost.length] gives the minimum cost required to reach the top of the stairs, which can be directly accessed after either the last step or the one before last.  

This method efficiently determines the minimum cost to climb to the top of the staircase using an iterative approach with a dynamic programming table, ensuring that each step is built upon the optimal decisions made in previous steps.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int[] dp = new int[cost.length + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 0;
        for(int i = 2; i <= cost.length; i++){
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2]);
        } 
        return dp[cost.length];
    }
}
```
