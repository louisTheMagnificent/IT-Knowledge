## Question:

Given an integer n, return the number of structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n.  

Example 1:  

Input: n = 3  
Output: 5  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 1  
Output: 1  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= n <= 19

## Thought:
We use 1d dp to do it.

This Java code implements the numTrees method in the Solution class, which calculates the number of unique binary search trees (BSTs) that can be constructed with n distinct nodes. The method uses dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.   

The code starts by handling the base case where n is 1, directly returning 1 since there's only one tree possible. It then initializes a dynamic programming array dp where dp[i] represents the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with i nodes. Base values are set for dp[0], dp[1], and dp[2].  

For each number from 3 to n, the code calculates the number of unique trees by considering each number j from 0 to i-1 as the root. It sums the products of the number of trees formed by the nodes on the left (dp[j]) and the nodes on the right (dp[i-j-1]) of the root. This process repeats until it fills the entire dp array, with dp[n] providing the total number of unique BSTs for n nodes.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int numTrees(int n) {
        if(n == 1) return 1;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;
        for(int i = 3; i <= n; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++){
                dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1];
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)  
Space complexity: O(n)
