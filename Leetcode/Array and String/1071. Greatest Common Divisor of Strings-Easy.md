## Question:

For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).  

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.  

Example 1:  

Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"  
Output: "ABC"  

Example 2:  

Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"  
Output: "AB"  

Example 3:  

Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"  
Output: ""  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000  
str1 and str2 consist of English uppercase letters.

## Thought: 
This code implements a recursive solution to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings. The idea is based on the observation that if a common divisor string exists, it must be a prefix of both strings and the strings must be composed of repeated patterns of that prefix. The algorithm checks if the shorter string is a prefix of the longer one and recursively applies the same logic by trimming the matched prefix from the longer string, effectively mimicking the Euclidean algorithm for integers but applied to strings.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public String gcdOfStrings(String str1, String str2) {
        if(str1.equals(str2)) return str1;
        if(str1.length() < str2.length()) return gcdOfStrings(str2, str1);
        if(!str2.equals(str1.substring(0, str2.length()))) return "";
        else{
            return gcdOfStrings(str2, str1.substring(str2.length(), str1.length()));
        }
    }
}
```
