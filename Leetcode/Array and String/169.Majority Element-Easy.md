## Question:

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]  
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]  
Output: 2
 
Constraints:

n == nums.length  
1 <= n <= 5 * 104  
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109  

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

## Thought:
We could use Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm to do it. When a element is a main element, it is shown more than n/2 times. We set 
the first element as the probable main element and set the count as 1. Then we start traversing the array, when the next element is the same 
count++ and count-- when different. When the count decreases to 0, it means the probable main element is fake and we set the current element 
as the new probable main element and keep doing the same thing. Because of the main element's feature, the count of the real main element will not 
be decreased to 0. Thus when we finish the traversal, the last candidate is the main element.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int candidate = 0;
        for(int i: nums){
            if(count == 0) candidate = i;
            if(i == candidate) count++;
            else count--;
        }
        
        return candidate;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
