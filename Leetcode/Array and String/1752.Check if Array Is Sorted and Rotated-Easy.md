## Question: 

Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.  

There may be duplicates in the original array.  

Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length], where % is the modulo operation.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]  
Output: true  

Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.  
You can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]  
Output: false  

Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.  

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3]  
Output: true  

Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.  
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 100    
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

## Thought:

The code checks whether an array can be considered as a rotated non-decreasing sorted array. It first identifies the point where the order first drops (the rotation point). If no drop is found, the array is already sorted. If a drop is found, it verifies that the remainder of the array is sorted and finally ensures that the last element does not exceed the first element, which confirms a valid rotation.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean check(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 1) return true;
        int minIndex = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i] < nums[i - 1]){
                minIndex = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        if(minIndex == 0) return true;
        for(int i = minIndex + 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) return false;
        }

        return nums[0] >= nums[nums.length - 1];
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
