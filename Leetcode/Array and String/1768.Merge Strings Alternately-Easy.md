## Question:

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.  

Return the merged string.  

Example 1:  

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"  
Output: "apbqcr"  

Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:  
word1:  a   b   c  
word2:    p   q   r  
merged: a p b q c r  

Example 2:  

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"  
Output: "apbqrs"  

Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.  
word1:  a   b   
word2:    p   q   r   s  
merged: a p b q   r   s  

Example 3:  

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"  
Output: "apbqcd"  

Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.  
word1:  a   b   c   d  
word2:    p   q   
merged: a p b q c   d  

Constraints:  

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100  
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

## Thought:
This Java code defines a method mergeAlternately that takes two strings, word1 and word2, and merges them by alternating characters from each string. It uses two indices, index1 and index2, to track positions in word1 and word2, appending characters alternately to a StringBuilder. When one string is exhausted, the remaining characters of the longer string are appended in full. Finally, the merged string is returned.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        int index1 = 0, index2 = 0;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while(index1 < word1.length() && index2 < word2.length()){
            sb.append(word1.charAt(index1));
            sb.append(word2.charAt(index2));
            index1++;
            index2++;
        }
        if(word1.length() == index1 && word2.length() != index2){
            while(index2 < word2.length()){
                sb.append(word2.charAt(index2));
                index2++;
            }
        }
        else if(word1.length() != index1 && word2.length() == index2){
            while(index1 < word1.length()){
                sb.append(word1.charAt(index1));
                index1++;
            }            
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
