## Question:

You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.  

Return true if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return false.  

Example 1:  

Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"  
Output: true  

Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".  

Example 2:  

Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"  
Output: false  

Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.  

Example 3:  

Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"  
Output: true  

Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100  
s1.length == s2.length  
s1 and s2 consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Thought:

This code checks if two strings can become equal by swapping at most one pair of characters. It iterates through both strings, tracking mismatched indices. If there are more than two mismatches, it returns false. If exactly two mismatches exist, it verifies whether swapping them makes the strings equal. If no mismatches exist, the strings are already equal.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean areAlmostEqual(String s1, String s2) {
        if(s1.length() != s2.length()) return false;
        int index1 = -1;
        int index2 = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++){
            if(s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)){
                if(index1 == -1){
                    index1 = i;
                }
                else if(index1 != -1 && index2 == -1){
                    if(s1.charAt(index1) == s2.charAt(i) && s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(index1)){
                        index2 = i;
                    }
                    else return false;
                }
                else return false;
            }
        }
        if(index1 == -1) return true;
        else if(index1 != -1 && index2 == -1) return false;
        else return true;
    }
}
```
