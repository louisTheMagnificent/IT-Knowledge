## Question: 

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3  
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]  

Explanation:  
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]  
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]  
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]  

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2  
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]  

Explanation:   
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]  
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105  
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1  
0 <= k <= 105

Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.  
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

## Thought 1:
We can use the Ring replacement method to do it.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        if(nums.length == 1) return;
        if(k > nums.length) k = k % nums.length;
        if(k == 0) return;
        int count = 0;
        int index = 0;
        int pointer = 0;
        int exchange = nums[pointer];
        
        while(count < nums.length){
            int num = exchange;
            pointer += k;
            if(pointer >= nums.length) pointer -= nums.length;
            exchange = nums[pointer];
            nums[pointer] = num;            
            count++; 
            if(count == nums.length) break;
            if(pointer == index){
                pointer++;
                index++;
                exchange = nums[pointer];
            } 
        }
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Spaca complexity: O(1)

## Thought 2:
We can do it by reversing the array for 3 times. First we reverse the whole array. Second, we reverse the first k elements. Finally, 
we reverse the rest elements.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        if(k > nums.length) k = k % nums.length;
        if(k == 0) return;
        reverse(0, nums.length - 1, nums);
        reverse(0, k - 1, nums);
        reverse(k, nums.length - 1, nums);
    }

    private void reverse(int i, int j, int[] nums){
        while(i < j){
            int num = nums[i];
            nums[i] = nums[j];
            nums[j] = num;
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(1)
