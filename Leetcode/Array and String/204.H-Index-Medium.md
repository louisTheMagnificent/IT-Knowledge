## Question:

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.  

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.  

Example 1:  

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]  
Output: 3  

Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.  
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

Example 2:  

Input: citations = [1,3,1]  
Output: 1  

Constraints:  

n == citations.length  
1 <= n <= 5000  
0 <= citations[i] <= 1000

## Thought: 
This Java class defines a method to calculate the h-index of an academic by counting citations for their papers. The hIndex method initializes an array, citationsCount, with a length one more than the number of papers to handle citation counts efficiently. It populates this array by incrementing counts at positions corresponding to the citations each paper received, capping increments at the position equal to the number of papers. This is because an h-index cannot exceed the total number of papers. The method then iterates backwards from the highest possible h-index, accumulating the number of papers with at least that many citations. The first time the cumulative count meets or exceeds the index value, it returns that value as the h-index, effectively determining the maximum h-index according to its definition. If no such index is found, it returns zero, indicating no h-index is applicable. This approach avoids the need to sort the citations, thereby achieving a linear time complexity.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int papers = citations.length;
        int[] citationsCount = new int[papers + 1];
        for(int citation : citations){
            citationsCount[Math.min(citation, papers)]++;
        }

        int count = 0;
        for(int hIndex = papers; hIndex >= 0; hIndex--){
            count += citationsCount[hIndex];
            if(count >= hIndex){
                return hIndex;
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```
