## Question:

You are given a sorted unique integer array nums.  

A range [a,b] is the set of all integers from a to b (inclusive).  

Return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of nums is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer x such that x is in one of the ranges but not in nums.  

Each range [a,b] in the list should be output as:  

"a->b" if a != b  
"a" if a == b  
 
Example 1:  

Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]  
Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]  

Explanation: The ranges are:  
[0,2] --> "0->2"  
[4,5] --> "4->5"  
[7,7] --> "7"  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]  
Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]  

Explanation: The ranges are:  
[0,0] --> "0"  
[2,4] --> "2->4"  
[6,6] --> "6"  
[8,9] --> "8->9"  
 
Constraints:  

0 <= nums.length <= 20  
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1  
All the values of nums are unique.  
nums is sorted in ascending order.

## Thought:

This Java code provides a solution to summarize numeric ranges in a sorted integer array where each range consists of consecutive numbers. The goal is to produce a list of strings representing these ranges. Hereâ€™s a concise overview of how the code works:  

Initialization:  
The function initializes an empty list result to store the range summaries. It also uses two pointers, slow and fast, initialized to the beginning of the array. The slow pointer marks the start of a new range, and fast is used to explore the array for the end of that range.  

Edge Case Handling:  
If the input array nums is empty, the function immediately returns the empty result list.   

Iterate Through the Array:  
The function uses a while loop to traverse the array with the fast pointer. During each iteration, it checks if the current number (nums[fast]) continues the range from the previous number (nums[fast-1]). If not, it means the end of the current range has been reached.  

Build and Store Ranges:  
Whenever the end of a range is found (i.e., nums[fast] is not consecutive to nums[fast-1]), a StringBuilder is used to format the range starting from nums[slow] to nums[fast-1]. If slow equals fast-1, the range consists of a single number.  
This formatted range string is then added to the result list, and slow is updated to fast to mark the beginning of a new range.  

Handle the Last Range:  
After exiting the loop, there is one remaining range to process, starting at nums[slow] and ending at nums[fast-1] (since fast would have reached the array's length). This last range is built and added to the result.  

Return Result:  
Finally, the function returns the result list containing all the summarized ranges.  

This approach ensures that all consecutive numbers are grouped into ranges efficiently, and any single numbers are also correctly handled. The use of two pointers allows for a single pass through the array, making the solution both effective and efficient.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<String> summaryRanges(int[] nums) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if(nums.length == 0) return result;
        int slow = 0;
        int fast = 1;
        while(fast < nums.length){
            if(nums[fast] - nums[fast - 1] != 1){
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                sb.append(nums[slow]);
                if(fast - 1 > slow){
                    sb.append("->");
                    sb.append(nums[fast - 1]);
                }
                result.add(sb.toString());
                slow = fast;
            }
            fast++;
        }
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append(nums[slow]);
        if(fast - 1 > slow){
            sb.append("->");
            sb.append(nums[fast - 1]);
        }
        result.add(sb.toString());
        return result;
    }
}
```
