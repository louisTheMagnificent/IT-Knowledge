## Question:

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].  

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.  

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.   
 
Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]  
Output: [24,12,8,6]  

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]  
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]  
 
Constraints:  

2 <= nums.length <= 105  
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30  
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.  
 
Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

## Thought: 
This Java code defines a solution to the "Product of Array Except Self" problem, where the goal is to create an array result such that each element at index i of result is equal to the product of all the elements of the given array nums except nums[i]. The solution is implemented without using division and achieves this in linear time complexity with constant space complexity, excluding the space used by the output array.  
The solution first initializes the result array where each element result[i] is set to the product of all elements to the left of i in nums. This is done in the first loop. Specifically, for each index i, if i is 0, result[i] is set to 1 (since there are no elements to the left of the first element). For other indices, result[i] is calculated as the product of result[i - 1] and nums[i - 1].  
After constructing the array of left products, the code initializes a variable suffix to handle the products of elements to the right of each index. The second loop iterates the array from the end to the start. For each element, it updates result[i] by multiplying it with suffix, which accumulates the product of elements to the right of i. This updates result[i] to be the product of all elements except nums[i] as required by the problem.  
The method efficiently calculates the desired product using two linear passes over the input array: one forward pass to gather the left products and one backward pass to combine these with the right products. This approach optimally solves the problem by avoiding the direct use of division and minimizing extra space usage.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(i == 0){
                result[i] = 1;
            }
            else{
                result[i] = result[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
            }
        }
        int suffix = 1;
        for(int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--){
            if(i == nums.length - 1){
                continue;
            }
            else{
                suffix *= nums[i + 1];
                result[i] *= suffix;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
