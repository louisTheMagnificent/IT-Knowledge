## Question:

Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.  

Example 1:  

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]  
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]  

Example 2:  

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]  
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]  

Constraints:  

m == matrix.length  
n == matrix[i].length  
1 <= m, n <= 10  
-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100

## Thought:
This Java code defines a method, spiralOrder, which takes a 2D integer matrix and returns a list of integers representing the elements of the matrix in spiral order. The method initializes the boundaries (startX, startY, horizontal, vertical) to define the top-left and bottom-right corners of the matrix spiral that needs to be processed.  
The main part of the method involves a loop that processes the matrix layer by layer from the outermost to the innermost, adjusting the boundaries after each full iteration:  
It begins by traversing the top row from left to right.  
Next, it moves down the right column.  
It then traverses the bottom row from right to left.  
Finally, it moves up the left column.  

After completing each "ring" or layer of the spiral, the starting indices (startX, startY) are incremented, and the dimensions of the layer (horizontal, vertical) are decremented by two to move to the next inner layer. This continues until there are no more complete layers to process.  
For matrices with a remaining row or column after processing all complete layers (typically when the matrix is not square or has an odd dimension), the method handles these as special cases:  
If there is a single remaining row in the middle of the matrix, it adds the remaining elements from left to right.  
If there is a single remaining column in the middle, it adds the elements from top to bottom.  
If the matrix is reduced to a single element in the center, it directly adds that element.  

The result is a list that captures all elements of the matrix in the order of a spiral traversal, which is then returned. This approach ensures that all elements are processed in the correct spiral order without revisiting any element.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> spiralOrder(int[][] matrix) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int startX = 0;
        int startY = 0;
        int horizontal = matrix[0].length - 1;
        int vertical = matrix.length - 1;
        int i,j;
        while(horizontal > 0 && vertical > 0){
            
            for(i = startX; i < startX + horizontal; i++){
                result.add(matrix[startY][i]);
            }

            for(j = startY; j < startY + vertical; j++){
                result.add(matrix[j][i]);
            }

            for(; i > startX; i--){
                result.add(matrix[j][i]);
            }

            for(; j > startY; j--){
                result.add(matrix[j][startX]);
            }

            startX++;
            startY++;
            horizontal -= 2;
            vertical -= 2;
        }

        if(horizontal > 0 && startY == (matrix.length - 1) / 2){
            for(i = startX; i <= startX + horizontal; i++){
                result.add(matrix[startY][i]);
            }
        }
        else if(vertical > 0 && startX == (matrix[0].length - 1) / 2){
            for(j = startY; j <= startY + vertical; j++){
                result.add(matrix[j][startX]);
            }
        }
        else if(startY == (matrix.length - 1) / 2 && startX == (matrix[0].length - 1) / 2){
            result.add(matrix[startY][startX]);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
