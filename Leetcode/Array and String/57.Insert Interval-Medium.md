## Question:

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.  

Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).  

Return intervals after the insertion.  

Note that you don't need to modify intervals in-place. You can make a new array and return it.  

Example 1:  

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]  
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]  

Example 2:  

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]  
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]  

Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].  
 
Constraints:  

0 <= intervals.length <= 104  
intervals[i].length == 2  
0 <= starti <= endi <= 105  
intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.  
newInterval.length == 2  
0 <= start <= end <= 105

## Thought: 

This Java code provides a solution for inserting a new interval into a list of non-overlapping intervals and merging all necessary intervals so that no two intervals overlap. The function insert handles the merging of intervals dynamically as the new interval is inserted into the existing sorted list of intervals. Here's a brief overview of the approach:  

Initialization:  
The function starts by initializing a list res to store the result and a variable i to track the current index in the original intervals list.  

Skip Non-Overlapping Intervals Before New Interval:  
The function iterates through the intervals array and adds all intervals to res that end before the start of the newInterval. This continues until it finds an interval that might overlap with newInterval.  

Merge Overlapping Intervals:  
Once an interval that potentially overlaps with newInterval is found, the function enters a loop where it continuously merges any overlapping intervals with newInterval. It updates newInterval by setting its start to the minimum of its current start and the current intervalâ€™s start, and its end to the maximum of its current end and the current interval's end. This merging stops when an interval does not overlap with the updated newInterval.  

Add the Merged New Interval:  
After merging, newInterval, which now contains the merged range of all overlapping intervals, is added to the result list.  

Add Remaining Intervals:  
Any remaining intervals in the intervals array that start after the end of the newInterval are added to the result list.  

Convert List to Array:  
Finally, the list res is converted to a 2D array and returned.  

This approach ensures that the list of intervals remains sorted and non-overlapping by carefully inserting and merging the new interval in its correct position, handling both the scenarios where the newInterval overlaps with existing intervals and where it does not.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[][] insert(int[][] intervals, int[] newInterval){
        int n = intervals.length, i = 0;
        List<int[]> res = new ArrayList<>();

        while (i < n && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]){
            res.add(intervals[i]);
            i++;
        }

        while (i < n && newInterval[1] >= intervals[i][0]){
            newInterval[0] = Math.min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]);
            newInterval[1] = Math.max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1]);
            i++;
        }
        res.add(newInterval);

        while (i < n) {
            res.add(intervals[i]);
            i++;
        }

        return res.toArray(new int[res.size()][]);
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
