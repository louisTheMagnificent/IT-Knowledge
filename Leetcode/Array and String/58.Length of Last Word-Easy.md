## Question: 

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.  

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "Hello World"  
Output: 5  

Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "  
Output: 4  

Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.  

Example 3:  

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"  
Output: 6  

Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.  

Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 104  
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.  
There will be at least one word in s.

## Thought:
In order to do it faster with less space, we traverse the string from the last character. We start counting when we meet the 
first non-space character until we meet another space. Then we return the count.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int result = 0;
        int currentLength = 0;
        for(int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--){
            if(s.charAt(i) == ' '){
                if(result == 0){
                    continue;
                }
                else{
                    return result;
                }
            }
            else{
                result++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
