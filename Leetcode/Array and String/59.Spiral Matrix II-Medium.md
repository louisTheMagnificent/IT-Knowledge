## Question:

Given a positive integer n, generate an n x n matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.   

Example 1:  

Input: n = 3  
Output: [[1,2,3],[8,9,4],[7,6,5]]  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 1  
Output: [[1]]  
 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 20

## Thought:
This Java code defines a method, generateMatrix, that creates an n x n spiral matrix filled with numbers from 1 to n^2. The method uses a layer-by-layer approach, filling the matrix in a clockwise spiral pattern.  
The variables startX and startY represent the starting row and column for each layer of the spiral, while offset helps in determining the boundaries of the current layer. The count variable keeps track of the current number to place in the matrix. The matrix is filled from the outermost layer to the innermost, adjusting the start point and reducing the effective size of the matrix (offset increment) after completing each full spiral cycle (loop).  
The filling process involves four steps:  
Filling the top row from left to right.  
Filling the right column from top to bottom.  
Filling the bottom row from right to left.  
Filling the left column from bottom to top.  
After each complete spiral, the starting point is moved inward (startX and startY are incremented), and the layer size is effectively reduced by incrementing the offset. The loop variable ensures that the process continues until all layers are filled.  
For matrices of odd dimension (n is odd), the center of the matrix is filled last, after all the spiral layers are done. This is handled by a check on the odd dimension (n % 2 == 1) and directly placing the last number at the center position.  
The method returns the filled spiral matrix.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[][] generateMatrix(int n) {
        int[][] nums = new int[n][n];
        int startX = 0, startY = 0;
        int offset = 1;
        int count = 1;
        int loop = 1;
        int i, j;

        while (loop <= n / 2) {

            for (j = startY; j < n - offset; j++) {
                nums[startX][j] = count++;
            }

            for (i = startX; i < n - offset; i++) {
                nums[i][j] = count++;
            }

            for (; j > startY; j--) {
                nums[i][j] = count++;
            }

            for (; i > startX; i--) {
                nums[i][j] = count++;
            }
            startX++;
            startY++;
            offset++;
            loop++;
        }
        if (n % 2 == 1) {
            nums[startX][startY] = count;
        }
        return nums;
    }
}
```
