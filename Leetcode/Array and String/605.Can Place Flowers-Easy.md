## Question:

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.  

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.  

Example 1:  

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1  
Output: true  

Example 2:  

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2  
Output: false  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104  
flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.  
There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.  
0 <= n <= flowerbed.length  

---
## Thought:
The algorithm iterates through the flowerbed array from left to right, checking at each position whether a flower can be planted without violating the rule that no two flowers can be adjacent. A flower can be planted at a position if it is 0 (empty) and both its left and right neighbors (if they exist) are also 0. When such a position is found, the algorithm sets it to 1 to mark the flower as planted and decrements the required flower count n. The process continues until either all required flowers are planted (n == 0) or the end of the array is reached. If n reaches 0, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        if(n == 0) return true;
        if(flowerbed.length == 1){
            if(n == 1 && flowerbed[0] == 0) return true;
            else return false;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++){
            if(n == 0) return true;
            if(i == 0){
                if(flowerbed[i] == 0 && flowerbed[i + 1] == 0){
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    n--;
                }
                else continue;
            }
            else if(i == flowerbed.length - 1){
                if(flowerbed[i] == 0 && flowerbed[i - 1] == 0){
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    n--;
                }
                else continue;
            }
            else{
                if(flowerbed[i] == 0 && flowerbed[i - 1] == 0 && flowerbed[i + 1] == 0){
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    n--;
                }
                else continue;
            }
        }
        return n == 0;
    }
}
