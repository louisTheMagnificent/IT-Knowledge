## Question:

Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.  

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.  

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.  

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.  

Note:  

A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.  
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.  
The input array words contains at least one word.  

Example 1:  

Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16  
Output:  
[  
   "This    is    an",  
   "example  of text",  
   "justification.  "  
]  

Example 2:  

Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16  
Output:  
[  
  "What   must   be",  
  "acknowledgment  ",  
  "shall be        "  
]  

Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.  
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.  

Example 3:  

Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20  
Output:  
[  
  "Science  is  what we",  
  "understand      well",  
  "enough to explain to",  
  "a  computer.  Art is",  
  "everything  else  we",  
  "do                  "  
]  

Constraints:  

1 <= words.length <= 300  
1 <= words[i].length <= 20  
words[i] consists of only English letters and symbols.  
1 <= maxWidth <= 100  
words[i].length <= maxWidth

## Thought:
This Java code implements a solution for the "Text Justification" problem. It aligns words into fully justified text by adjusting spaces between words. The fullJustify method takes an array of words and a maximum width maxWidth for each line. The method returns a list of strings where each string represents a justified line.  
The solution involves iterating over the words and building lines that fit within the specified maxWidth. Words are added to the current line until adding another word would exceed the maximum width. At this point, the method calculates the number of spaces needed and distributes them evenly between words on the line. Special care is taken for edge cases such as when a line contains only one word or two words, ensuring that spaces are added appropriately.  
For the last line of text, words are left-justified, meaning that spaces are only added between words and extra spaces are added at the end of the line until the line reaches the maxWidth.  
The algorithm handles:  
Building lines word by word.  
Adjusting spaces when the current line can no longer accommodate more words.  
Applying different spacing rules for normal and last lines.  
Ensuring that the text is fully justified according to the requirements, with spaces distributed as evenly as possible on all lines except for the last line.  
This solution efficiently constructs each line of justified text by iterating through the words and using a StringBuilder to manage the creation of each line's string representation, making it both time and space efficient.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<String> fullJustify(String[] words, int maxWidth) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int size = words.length;
        int i = 0;
        int currentLength = 0;
        int start = 0;
        while(i < size){
            if(currentLength + words[i].length() <= maxWidth){
                currentLength += words[i].length() + 1;
                i++;
            }
            else{
                int num = i - start;
                int spaceNum = maxWidth;
                for(int j = start; j < i; j++){
                    spaceNum -= words[j].length();
                }
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                sb.append(words[start]);
                if(num == 1){
                    for(int j = 0; j < spaceNum; j++){
                        sb.append(' ');
                    }
                }
                else if(num == 2){
                    for(int j = 0; j < spaceNum; j++){
                        sb.append(' ');
                    }
                    sb.append(words[++start]);
                }
                else{
                    int eachSpace = spaceNum / (num - 1);
                    int remainder = spaceNum % (num - 1);
                    for(int j = start + 1; j < i; j++){
                        for(int k = 0; k < eachSpace; k++){
                            sb.append(' ');
                        }
                        if(remainder > 0){
                            sb.append(' ');
                            remainder--;
                        }
                        sb.append(words[j]);
                    }
                }
                result.add(sb.toString());
                start = i;
                currentLength = 0;
            } 
        }
        if(start < i){
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            sb.append(words[start]);
            start++;
            while(start < i){
                sb.append(' ');
                sb.append(words[start]);
                start++;
            }
            for(int j = currentLength - 1; j < maxWidth; j++){
                sb.append(' ');
            }
            result.add(sb.toString());
        }
        return result;
    }
}
