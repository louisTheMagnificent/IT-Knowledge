## Question:

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.  

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:  

Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").  
Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.  
Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.  
Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.  
Return the integer as the final result.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "42"  

Output: 42  

Explanation:  

The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.  
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)  
         ^  
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')  
         ^  
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)  
           ^  
           
Example 2:  

Input: s = " -042"  

Output: -42  

Explanation:  

Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)  
            ^  
Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)  
             ^  
Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)  
               ^  
               
Example 3:  

Input: s = "1337c0d3"  

Output: 1337  

Explanation:  

Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)  
         ^  
Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')  
         ^  
Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)  
             ^  
             
Example 4:  

Input: s = "0-1"  

Output: 0  

Explanation:  

Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)  
         ^  
Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')  
         ^  
Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)  
          ^  
          
Example 5:  

Input: s = "words and 987"  

Output: 0  

Explanation:  

Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.  

Constraints:  

0 <= s.length <= 200  
s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.

## Thought:
This Java code defines a method called myAtoi which simulates the functionality of the atoi (ASCII to integer) function to convert a string to an integer. The method first trims any whitespace from the beginning and end of the string. It checks for a positive or negative sign at the start, and then processes each character in the trimmed string sequentially. If a character is a digit, it is converted into its numerical value and accumulated into the result while checking for integer overflow or underflow conditions. If a non-digit character is encountered after the number has started processing, the function immediately returns the current result. The final result is adjusted for the sign and returned. The code handles edge cases like sign determination, overflow, underflow, and early termination on non-digit characters after the sequence of digits.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int myAtoi(String s) {
        if(s.length() == 0) return 0;
        int result = 0;
        boolean isPositive = true;
        String trimmed = s.trim();
        int i = 0;
        while(i < trimmed.length()){
            if(i == 0 && trimmed.charAt(i) == '-'){
                isPositive = false;
                i++;
                continue;
            }
            else if(i == 0 && trimmed.charAt(i) == '+'){
                i++;
                continue;
            }
            char curr = trimmed.charAt(i);

            if(Character.isDigit(curr)){
                int num = curr - '0';
                if(isPositive){
                    if(result > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 || (result == Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 && num > 7)) return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                    result = result * 10 + num;
                }
                else{
                    if(result < Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 || (result == Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 && num > 8)) return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                    result = result * 10 - num;
                }
                i++;
            }
            else{
                return result;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
