## Question:

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:  

Input: x = 121  
Output: true  

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.  

Example 2:  

Input: x = -121  
Output: false  

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.  

Example 3:  

Input: x = 10  
Output: false  

Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.  

Constraints:  

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1  
 
Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Thought: 
We only use Integer to do it. First we deal with the edge case, if the number is less than 0 or the number ends with 0 except number 0, 
we return false directly. Then we get the right part of the number and convert it into the left part form. And then we check whether the new
number is equal to the left part. If so, return true. If not, return false.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)){
            return false;
        }

        int rightPart = 0;

        while(x > rightPart){
            int num = x % 10;
            rightPart = 10 * rightPart + num;
            x = x / 10;
        }

        return x == rightPart || x == rightPart / 10;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(Number of digits in x)
Space complexity: O(1)
