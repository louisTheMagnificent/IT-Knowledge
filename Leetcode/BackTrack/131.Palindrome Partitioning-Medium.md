## Question:

Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.   

Example 1:  

Input: s = "aab"  
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "a"  
Output: [["a"]]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 16  
s contains only lowercase English letters.

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.

The Java code provided implements a solution for partitioning a string into all possible palindrome partitions using a backtracking approach. The code generates all subsets of the input string s that can be split into palindromic subsequences. Hereâ€™s an outline of how the algorithm functions:  

Initialization:  
result: An ArrayList of List<String> that stores the final list of all palindromic partitions.  
curr: An ArrayList of String used to maintain the current partition being explored.  

Backtracking Method (backtrack):  
This recursive method backtrack explores potential partitions starting from a given position start in the string s.  
sb (StringBuilder) is used to accumulate characters to form potential palindromic substrings as the recursion progresses.  

Recursive Exploration:  
The base case checks if start equals the length of s. If true, it means a valid partitioning has been found and it is added to result.  
The method iterates from start to the end of the string s. In each iteration:  
The character at position i is appended to sb.  
The check method is called to determine if the substring accumulated in sb forms a palindrome.  
If sb is a palindrome, it is added to curr, and backtrack is called recursively with the start position moved past the current substring (i.e., i + 1).  
After the recursive call, the last palindrome added to curr is removed to backtrack and explore other potential partitions starting from the next position.  

Palindrome Checking (check):  
The check function validates whether the contents of sb form a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.  
If all corresponding characters match, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.  

Efficiency Considerations:
Every recursive call potentially starts building a new palindrome from the next starting position, ensuring that all combinations of substrings are explored for palindromic properties.  
The use of a StringBuilder (sb) to accumulate characters and check for palindromic properties optimizes the substring handling by avoiding repeated string slicing, which could be costly.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<List<String>> result;
    private List<String> curr;

    public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        curr = new ArrayList<>();

        backtrack(s, 0, new StringBuilder());

        return result;

    }

    public void backtrack(String s, int start, StringBuilder sb){
        if(start == s.length()){
            result.add(new ArrayList(curr));
            return;
        }

        for(int i = start; i < s.length(); i++){
            sb.append(s.charAt(i));
            if(check(sb)){
                curr.add(sb.toString());
                backtrack(s, i + 1, new StringBuilder());
                curr.removeLast();
            }
        }

        return;
    }

    public boolean check(StringBuilder sb){
        int front = 0;
        int last = sb.length() - 1;
        while(front < last){
            if(sb.charAt(front) != sb.charAt(last)) return false;
            front++;
            last--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
