## Question:

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]  

Example 2:  

Input: digits = ""  
Output: []  

Example 3:  

Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]  

Constraints:  

0 <= digits.length <= 4  
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

## Thought: 
We use the backTrack to do it. First we need a hashmap to store the letters each number could be converted into. We use as stringBuilder to store the current combination and 
use a list to store result and a index to track the current number we are accessing. The base case is that if the length of the stringBuilder 
is equal to the index, it means we have finished a combination and we convert the stringBuilder to a string and add it to the result. The recursive case is that 
first we get the current number and check which letter it could be converted then we add one of the letters into the stringBuilder. And we do the backTrack to each 
letter. When we finish a letter, we delete it from the end of the stringBuilder. Finally we return the result.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<String> result;
    private StringBuilder currentString;
    private Map<Character, String> hashMap;

    public List<String> letterCombinations(String digits) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        if(digits == null || digits.length() == 0) return result;

        currentString = new StringBuilder();
        hashMap = new HashMap<>();
        hashMap.put('2', "abc");
        hashMap.put('3', "def");
        hashMap.put('4', "ghi");
        hashMap.put('5', "jkl");
        hashMap.put('6', "mno");
        hashMap.put('7', "pqrs");
        hashMap.put('8', "tuv");
        hashMap.put('9', "wxyz");

        backTrack(digits, currentString, 0);

        return result;
    }

    private void backTrack(String digits, StringBuilder currentString, int currentIndex){
        if(currentIndex == digits.length()){
            result.add(currentString.toString());
        }
        else{
            char currentNum = digits.charAt(currentIndex);
            String currentCharStr = hashMap.get(currentNum);
            for(int i = 0; i < currentCharStr.length(); i++){
                currentString.append(currentCharStr.charAt(i));
                backTrack(digits, currentString, currentIndex + 1);
                currentString.deleteCharAt(currentString.length() - 1);
            }
        }
    } 
}
```
Time complexity: O(len(digits))  
Space complexity: O(len(digits))
