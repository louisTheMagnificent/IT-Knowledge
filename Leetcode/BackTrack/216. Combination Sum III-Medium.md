## Question:

Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:  

Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.  
Each number is used at most once.  
Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.  

Example 1:  

Input: k = 3, n = 7  
Output: [[1,2,4]]  

Explanation:  
1 + 2 + 4 = 7  
There are no other valid combinations.  

Example 2:  

Input: k = 3, n = 9  
Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]  

Explanation:  
1 + 2 + 6 = 9  
1 + 3 + 5 = 9  
2 + 3 + 4 = 9  
There are no other valid combinations.  

Example 3:  

Input: k = 4, n = 1  
Output: []  

Explanation: There are no valid combinations.  
Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.  
 
Constraints:  

2 <= k <= 9  
1 <= n <= 60

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.

The provided Java code implements a solution to find all possible combinations of k distinct numbers that add up to a sum n, where the numbers must be from 1 to 9 and each combination can only use each number once. This is a classic example of a combination sum problem solved using backtracking. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the algorithm's design:  

Initialization:  
result is an ArrayList of List<Integer> that will store all the valid combinations that meet the criteria.  
path is an ArrayList of Integer used to track the current combination of numbers being considered.  

Backtracking Method (backTrack):  
The method backTrack is called recursively to explore all possible combinations. It accepts k (the number of numbers to find), n (the remaining sum required), and startIndex (the smallest number that can be used next in the combination to ensure numbers are distinct and in increasing order).  
Base Case: If the current combination (path) has k-1 numbers and the last number needed to reach n is valid (i.e., greater than the last number in path and less than 10), it is added to the path, the complete combination is added to result, and then the number is removed from path.  

Recursive Exploration: The loop iterates from startIndex to the maximum number possible which is calculated as n / (k - path.size()). This ensures that each number considered has a valid potential to reach the sum n with the remaining numbers needed.  
The number i is added to path, and backTrack is called with updated parameters: n - i (reduce the remaining sum by the number added) and i + 1 (ensure the next number is greater than the current).  
After recursion, the last added number is removed (path.removeLast()), allowing the loop to try the next number in the sequence.  

Result Compilation:  
The main method combinationSum3 initializes the process by calling backTrack with 1 as the startIndex and returns result after all possibilities have been explored.  
This approach effectively explores all combinations through backtracking by incrementally building each combination and recursively exploring further only if it remains feasible to reach n using k numbers. This method efficiently prunes the search space and ensures that all combinations are unique and in ascending order.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<List<Integer>> result;
    private List<Integer> path;
    
    public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum3(int k, int n) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        path = new ArrayList<>();

        backTrack(k, n, 1);

        return result;    
    }

    public void backTrack(int k, int n, int startIndex){
        if(path.size() == k - 1){
            if(n > path.getLast() && n < 10){
                path.add(n);
                result.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
                path.removeLast();
            }
            
            return;
        }

        for(int i = startIndex; i <= n / (k - path.size()); i++){
            path.add(i);
            backTrack(k, n - i, i + 1);
            path.removeLast();
        }

        return;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n * 2<sup>n</sup>)  
Space complexity: O(n)
