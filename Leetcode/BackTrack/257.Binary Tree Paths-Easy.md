## Question: 

Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.  

A leaf is a node with no children.  
  
Example 1:  

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]  
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [1]  
Output: ["1"]  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].  
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Thought: 
We use back track to do it.  
This Java code defines a method to collect all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree as strings. The method, binaryTreePaths, uses a backtracking approach implemented in the backTrack helper function. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the design: 

Initial Check:  
The binaryTreePaths method starts by checking if the root is null. If it is, it returns an empty list as there are no paths to collect.  

Backtracking Setup:  
A list of integers, list, is used to store the current path values as the recursion proceeds from the root to each leaf.  
The method then calls the recursive helper function backTrack with the current node, the path list, and the results list.  

Recursive Backtracking (backTrack method):  
The backTrack method adds the value of the current node (root.val) to the path list.  
If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has no left or right child), the method constructs a path string from the list using a StringBuffer. It iterates through the list to create a string with nodes separated by "->". This string is then added to the result list.  
If the current node is not a leaf, the method recursively calls itself for the left child if it exists, and then for the right child if it exists.  
After exploring both children, it removes the last element from the list to backtrack and explore other paths.  

Completion:  
After the recursive calls are complete, the list is backtracked by removing the last element added (ensuring paths are correctly maintained for each recursive call).  
The binaryTreePaths method returns the fully constructed list of path strings.  
This approach efficiently constructs all paths from the root to each leaf node by using backtracking to manage and revert changes to the path list as each node is visited. The recursive structure ensures that all paths are explored, and the use of a list to track the path state avoids the need for complex string manipulations within the recursive calls.

## Solution: 
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {

    public List<String> binaryTreePaths(TreeNode root) {
        
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if(root == null) return result;
        
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        backTrack(result, list, root);

        return result;
    }

    public void backTrack(List<String> result, List<Integer> list, TreeNode root){

        list.add(root.val);
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null){
            StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
            int i = 0;
            for(; i < list.size() - 1; i++){
                sb.append(list.get(i));
                sb.append("->");
            }
            sb.append(list.get(i));
            result.add(sb.toString());
        }
        else{
            if(root.left != null) backTrack(result, list, root.left);
            if(root.right != null) backTrack(result, list, root.right);
        }
        list.remove(list.size() - 1);

        return;
    }
}
```
