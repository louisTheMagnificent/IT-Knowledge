## Quesiton:

You are given a list of airline tickets where tickets[i] = [fromi, toi] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.  

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK", thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK". If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.  

For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].  

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.  

Example 1:  

Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]  
Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]  

Example 2:  

Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]  
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]  

Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= tickets.length <= 300  
tickets[i].length == 2  
fromi.length == 3  
toi.length == 3  
fromi and toi consist of uppercase English letters.  
fromi != toi

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.  

The provided Java code outlines a solution for the "Reconstruct Itinerary" problem. It uses backtracking to determine a possible itinerary from a list of flight tickets. Here's a concise explanation of the design:  

Data Preparation:  
The tickets list is processed to build a map where each key is a departure city and the value is another map. This nested map holds destination cities as keys and the number of tickets to that destination as values.  
TreeMap is used for the nested map to keep destinations sorted lexicographically.  

Initialization:  
The itinerary always starts from "JFK", so "JFK" is added to the result list.  

Backtracking Function (backTrack):   
The function checks if the itinerary has been completed by comparing the size of result to the number of tickets plus one (for the initial city).  
It iteratively explores all possible next cities from the current city (curr), retrieved from the end of the result list.  
For each valid next city (with remaining tickets available), it decrements the ticket count, adds the city to the itinerary, and recursively attempts to complete the itinerary from there.  
If a complete itinerary is found, it returns true. If not, it backtracks by removing the last added city and restoring the ticket count.  

Execution:  
Starts the backtracking with the total number of tickets and attempts to build a valid itinerary from "JFK".  

This method effectively explores all potential itineraries using a depth-first search approach, backtracking when a path does not lead to a solution, and leveraging the sorted nature of TreeMap to always pick the smallest lexicographical order next city. This ensures the itinerary is constructed in the correct order according to the problem's requirements.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<String> result;
    private Map<String, Map<String, Integer>> map;

    public List<String> findItinerary(List<List<String>> tickets) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        map = new HashMap<>();

        for(List<String> t : tickets){
            String start = t.get(0);
            String destination = t.get(1);
            Map<String, Integer> currMap;
            if(map.containsKey(start)){
                currMap = map.get(start);
                currMap.put(destination, currMap.getOrDefault(destination, 0) + 1);
            }
            else{
                currMap = new TreeMap<>();
                currMap.put(destination, 1);
                map.put(start, currMap);
            }
        }

        result.add("JFK");

        backTrack(tickets.size());

        return result;
    }

    public boolean backTrack(int ticketNum){
        if(result.size() == ticketNum + 1){
            return true;
        }

        String curr = result.get(result.size() - 1);

        if(map.containsKey(curr)){
            for(Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.get(curr).entrySet()){
                int count = entry.getValue();
                if(count > 0){
                    result.add(entry.getKey());
                    entry.setValue(count - 1);
                    if(backTrack(ticketNum)) return true;
                    result.removeLast();
                    entry.setValue(count);
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
