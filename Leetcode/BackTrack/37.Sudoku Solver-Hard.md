## Question:

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.  

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:  

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.  
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.  
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.  
The '.' character indicates empty cells.  

Example 1:  

Input: board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]  
Output: [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]  

Explanation: The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:  

Constraints:  

board.length == 9  
board[i].length == 9  
board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.  
It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.

This Java code is designed to solve the Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. Here's a brief overview of the approach:  

Backtracking Function (backtrack):  
The function recursively attempts to place numbers from '1' to '9' into an empty cell on the Sudoku board.  
It iterates through each row and column, looking for empty cells (denoted by '.').  
When an empty cell is found, it tries placing each number in it, checking for validity.  
If placing a number leads to a potential solution (i.e., the recursive call returns true), it continues; if not, it backtracks by resetting the cell and trying the next number.  
The recursion progresses by moving to the next column, and wraps to the next row when the end of a row is reached.  
The base case for the recursion is reaching beyond the last row, which means the board is successfully filled and returns true.  

Validation Function (isValid):  
Checks if placing a specific number in a given cell is valid.  
It ensures the number does not already appear in the same row, column, or the 3x3 subgrid the cell belongs to.  

Termination and Progression:  
The process terminates successfully when all cells are correctly filled, indicated by reaching past the last row.  
If no valid number can be placed in a cell, it returns false, leading to backtracking.  

This solution leverages depth-first search principles through recursion combined with backtracking to explore valid placements, systematically filling the board and retreating when necessary, ensuring all board constraints are maintained.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public void solveSudoku(char[][] board) {
        backtrack(board, 0, 0);
    }

    public boolean backtrack(char[][] board, int row, int col){
        int currRow = row;
        if(col == 9){
            currRow += + 1;
        }

        if(currRow == 9) return true;

        for(int i = currRow; i < 9; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < 9; j++){
                if(board[i][j] != '.') continue;
                for(char k = '1'; k <= '9'; k++){
                    if(isValid(i, j, k, board)){
                        board[i][j] = k;
                        if(backtrack(board, i, j + 1)) return true;
                        board[i][j] = '.';
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    public boolean isValid(int row, int col, char num, char[][] board){
        for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++){
            if(board[i][col] == num) return false;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++){
            if(board[row][i] == num) return false;
        }

        int rowW = row / 3;
        int colL = col / 3;
        for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++){
                if(board[rowW * 3 + i][colL * 3 + j] == num) return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
