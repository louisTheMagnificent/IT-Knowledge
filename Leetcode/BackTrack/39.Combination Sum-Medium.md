## Question:

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.  

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.  

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.  

Example 1:  

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7  
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]  

Explanation:  
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.  
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.  
These are the only two combinations.  

Example 2:  

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8  
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]  

Example 3:  

Input: candidates = [2], target = 1  
Output: []  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= candidates.length <= 30  
2 <= candidates[i] <= 40  
All elements of candidates are distinct.  
1 <= target <= 40

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.

The Java code provided defines a solution for the "Combination Sum" problem where the task is to find all unique combinations in an array candidates that sum up to the target number target. Each number in candidates can be used unlimited times in the combination. The solution employs a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the algorithm's design:  

Initialization:  
result is an ArrayList of List<Integer> to store the final list of combinations that meet the target sum.  
path is an ArrayList of Integer used to maintain the current combination being explored.  
The candidates array is sorted initially to help efficiently manage the branching in the recursion (by breaking early if the sum exceeds the target).  

Backtracking Method (backtrack):
The backtrack function is a recursive method that explores combinations of numbers starting from startIndex to see if they sum up to target.  
The function takes the current candidate array, target value, current cumulative sum (sum), and the startIndex for the loop to ensure combinations use elements from the current index onwards (handling combinations without repeating the same sets with different orders).  

Base Case:  
If sum equals target, a valid combination has been found. The current path is copied into result, ensuring the current state of path is saved as result stores references, not copies.  

Recursive Exploration:  
Iterate over the candidates starting from startIndex. If adding the current candidate to sum exceeds the target, break the loop to prevent unnecessary calculations (enabled by the sorted array).  
Add the current candidate to path and recursively call backtrack, increasing sum by the candidate's value and keeping the same startIndex (since candidates can be reused).  
After the recursive call, backtrack by removing the last added element from path and subtracting its value from sum to explore other potential combinations.  

Efficiency Considerations:  
Sorting the candidates array allows the algorithm to break early during the iteration when the sum exceeds the target, thus optimizing the process.  
The use of backtracking with appropriate addition and removal in path and adjustments in sum ensures that all possible combinations are explored without redundancy.  

This method effectively finds all unique combinations that meet the target sum using a backtracking approach that leverages sorting for efficiency and careful state management to explore all potential combinations.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<List<Integer>> result;
    private List<Integer> path;

    public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum(int[] candidates, int target) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        path = new ArrayList<>();

        Arrays.sort(candidates);

        backtrack(candidates, target, 0, 0);

        return result;
    }

    public void backtrack(int[] candidate, int target, int sum, int startIndex){

        if(sum == target){
            result.add(new ArrayList(path));
        }

        for(int i = startIndex; i < candidate.length; i++){
            if(sum + candidate[i] > target) break;
            path.add(candidate[i]);
            sum += candidate[i];
            backtrack(candidate, target, sum, i);
            path.removeLast();
            sum -= candidate[i];
        }

        return;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n * 2 <sup>n</sup>) 
Space complexity: O(target)
