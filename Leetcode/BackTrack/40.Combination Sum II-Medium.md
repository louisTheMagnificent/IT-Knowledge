## Question:

Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.  

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.  

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.  

Example 1:  

Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8  
Output:   
[  
[1,1,6],  
[1,2,5],  
[1,7],  
[2,6]  
]  

Example 2:  

Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5  
Output:   
[  
[1,2,2],  
[5]  
]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= candidates.length <= 100  
1 <= candidates[i] <= 50  
1 <= target <= 30

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.

The provided Java code implements a solution to the "Combination Sum II" problem, where the task is to find all unique combinations in an array candidates that sum up to the target number target, with the constraint that each number in candidates can be used only once in each combination. Hereâ€™s a summary of how the algorithm works:  

Initialization:  
result: an ArrayList of List<Integer> to store the final list of unique combinations that sum up to the target.  
path: an ArrayList of Integer used to maintain the current combination being explored.  
The candidates array is sorted initially to help efficiently manage the combination process and facilitate the skipping of duplicates.  

Backtracking Method (backtrack):  
The backtrack function is a recursive method that explores combinations of numbers starting from startIndex to check if they sum up to target.  
Parameters include the current candidate array, target value, current cumulative sum (sum), and the startIndex which indicates where in the candidates array the function should start looking for the next number to add.  

Base Case:  
If sum equals target, a valid combination has been found. The current path is copied into result to store the valid combination.  

Recursive Exploration:  
The function iterates over the candidates starting from startIndex. If adding the current candidate to sum would exceed the target, the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary calculations (this is more efficient due to the sorted nature of the array).  
For each candidate, if it is added to the path:  
The candidate is added to path, sum is incremented by the candidate's value, and backtrack is recursively called with startIndex set to i + 1 to ensure each number is only used once per combination.  
After the recursive call, the function backtracks by removing the last element added to path and decrementing sum to undo the last step and explore other potential combinations.  
To ensure uniqueness of combinations and avoid duplicates, if the next candidate in the loop is the same as the current one, the loop is incremented until a different candidate is found. 

Handling Duplicates:  
After adding a candidate to path and exploring its possibilities, the loop checks for consecutive duplicates in the array. If the next candidate is the same as the current one, it skips it by incrementing i. This prevents the generation of duplicate combinations from the same start point, which is crucial since each number can only be used once per combination but may appear multiple times in the initial candidates array.  

This method effectively finds all unique combinations that meet the target sum by using a backtracking approach that leverages sorting for efficiency and careful management of state and candidate positions to ensure all combinations are explored without redundancy. The handling of duplicates is particularly important to ensure the uniqueness of each combination listed in the final result.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<List<Integer>> result;
    private List<Integer> path;

    public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum2(int[] candidates, int target) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        path = new ArrayList<>();

        Arrays.sort(candidates);

        backtrack(candidates, target, 0, 0);

        return result;
    }

    public void backtrack(int[] candidate, int target, int sum, int startIndex){

        if(sum == target){
            result.add(new ArrayList(path));
        }

        for(int i = startIndex; i < candidate.length; i++){
            if(sum + candidate[i] > target) break;
            path.add(candidate[i]);
            sum += candidate[i];
            backtrack(candidate, target, sum, i + 1);
            path.removeLast();
            sum -= candidate[i];
            while(i < candidate.length - 1 && candidate[i] == candidate[i + 1]){
                i++;
            }
        }

        return;
    }    
}
```
