## Question:

Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3]  
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [0,1]  
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]  

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [1]  
Output: [[1]]  

Constraints:  
  
1 <= nums.length <= 6  
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10  
All the integers of nums are unique.

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.

The provided Java code outlines a solution to generate all possible permutations of a given array of integers using a recursive backtracking approach. The code systematically explores all permutations and collects them into a list. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the algorithm operates:  

Initialization:  
result: An ArrayList of List<Integer> that stores all the permutations generated.  
path: An ArrayList of Integer used to build up individual permutations.  
used: A boolean array used to track which elements in the input array nums have already been included in the current permutation path to prevent reuse.  

Backtracking Function (backtrack):  
This is a recursive method that constructs permutations:  
It first checks if the path size equals the length of nums. If true, it means a complete permutation has been constructed, so it's added to result.  
The method then iterates over the array nums to explore adding each element to the current permutation path.  

Recursive Exploration:  
Within the recursive function:  
The loop goes through each element in nums.  
If an element is already used (as indicated by the used[i] being true), the loop skips to the next iteration.  
If not used, the element is added to path, and its corresponding used index is set to true to mark it as included.  
A recursive call is then made to continue building the permutation from this new state.  
After the recursive call, backtracking occurs: the last element added to path is removed, and the corresponding used index is set back to false. This step undoes the previous addition to explore other potential permutations that could be formed with different elements.  

Generating All Permutations:  
The process starts with an empty path and all elements in used set to false, indicating that no elements have been used yet.  
As the recursion unfolds, each path is extended until it becomes a full permutation, at which point it's added to result.  
The recursive backtracking ensures that all possible configurations of elements are explored by adding each unused element in turn, then recursively proceeding to add the next, and backtracking to replace the last element added with the next possible unused element.  

Summary:  
This method ensures that every possible permutation of the array nums is considered and added to result. The use of the used array is crucial as it efficiently tracks which elements have been included in the current permutation, thus ensuring that each permutation is valid (contains each element exactly once). The approach leverages recursive backtracking to explore every permutation possibility, making sure that after exploring one possibility, it properly reverts changes (backtracks) to explore the next possibility.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<List<Integer>> result;
    private List<Integer> path;
    private boolean[] used;

    public List<List<Integer>> permute(int[] nums) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        path = new ArrayList<>();
        used = new boolean[nums.length];

        backtrack(nums);

        return result;
    }

    public void backtrack(int[] nums){
        if(path.size() == nums.length){
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
            return;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(used[i]) continue;
            else{
                path.add(nums[i]);
                used[i] = true;
                backtrack(nums);
                path.removeLast();
                used[i] = false;
            }
        }
        return;
    }
}
```
