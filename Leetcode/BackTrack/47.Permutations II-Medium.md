## Question:

Given a collection of numbers, nums, that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations in any order.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,1,2]  
Output:  
[[1,1,2],  
 [1,2,1],  
 [2,1,1]]  
 
Example 2:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3]  
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 8  
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it  

The Java code provided defines a solution to generate all unique permutations of a given array of integers, where the array may contain duplicates. The solution employs a backtracking approach enhanced with a mechanism to avoid generating duplicate permutations. Here's a breakdown of the algorithm's design:  

Initialization:  
result: An ArrayList of List<Integer> that stores all the unique permutations generated.  
path: An ArrayList of Integer used to build individual permutations.  
used: A boolean array used to indicate which elements in the input array nums have been included in the current permutation path.  

Backtracking Function (backtrack):  
This recursive method constructs permutations by choosing elements that have not yet been used in the current permutation path.  
It checks if the path has reached the size of nums, indicating a complete permutation, which is then added to result.  

Unique Element Handling:  
A secondary tracking mechanism, usedValue, is introduced to ensure that the same number is not used more than once at each recursive level, thereby preventing duplicates in the permutation list. This array acts as a frequency counter specifically for the scope of each recursive call.  
usedValue is an array of size 21 to handle potential integer values within a specific range (assuming nums values range from -10 to 10 based on the offset used in the index).  

Recursive Exploration:  
The method iterates through each element in nums:  
Skips elements that have already been used (used[i] is true) or have been used in the current recursive stack (usedValue[nums[i] + 10] != 0).  
If an element passes these checks, it is added to path, and its status is updated in both used and usedValue.  
Recursive call is made to build the permutation further with the updated path.  
Upon returning from recursion (backtracking), the last element is removed from path, and its status in both tracking arrays is reset to allow for other permutations.  

Handling Duplicates:  
The use of usedValue at each recursion level is crucial for managing duplicates effectively. By marking an element as used within the context of a specific recursive call, the algorithm ensures that when there are duplicate values in nums, each permutation only includes a particular element once per its position in the permutation.  

Summary:  
This method efficiently generates all unique permutations of an array by using a backtracking approach that systematically explores all permutations, leveraging two tracking arrays to handle element usage and prevent duplicates efficiently. The dual tracking ensures that the solution set contains no duplicate permutations and respects the constraints of each permutation containing each element exactly once.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<List<Integer>> result;
    private List<Integer> path;
    private boolean[] used;
    public List<List<Integer>> permuteUnique(int[] nums) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        path = new ArrayList<>();
        used = new boolean[nums.length];

        backtrack(nums);
        return result;
    }

    public void backtrack(int[] nums){
        if(path.size() == nums.length){
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
            return;
        }
        int[] usedValue = new int[21];
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(used[i] || usedValue[nums[i] + 10] != 0){
                continue;
            }
            else{
                path.add(nums[i]);
                used[i] = true;
                usedValue[nums[i] + 10] = 1;
                backtrack(nums);
                path.removeLast();
                used[i] = false;
            }
        }
        return;
    }
}
```
