## Question:

Given an integer array nums, return all the different possible non-decreasing subsequences of the given array with at least two elements. You may return the answer in any order.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [4,6,7,7]  
Output: [[4,6],[4,6,7],[4,6,7,7],[4,7],[4,7,7],[6,7],[6,7,7],[7,7]]  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [4,4,3,2,1]  
Output: [[4,4]]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 15  
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.

The provided Java code defines a solution for finding all possible subsequences of a given array of integers that are non-decreasing. Each subsequence must have at least two elements. The approach uses backtracking to explore potential subsequences and ensure that they meet the criteria. Hereâ€™s how the algorithm is designed:  

Initialization:  
result: An ArrayList of List<Integer> that stores all valid subsequences.  
path: An ArrayList of Integer used to build and track the current subsequence being explored.  

Backtracking Method (backtrack):  
The backtrack method is a recursive function that explores potential subsequences starting from a given index startIndex.  
A local array used of size 201 is utilized to ensure that within a single recursive call level, the same element is not used more than once to start a subsequence. This prevents duplicates in the subsequences.  

Recursive Exploration:  
Adding Valid Subsequences: If path has at least two elements, it is added to result. This check is done at the beginning of each recursive call to capture all valid subsequences as the recursion progresses.  
Avoid Duplicates and Maintain Order: As the method iterates over the array elements starting from startIndex:  
It skips the current element if it would create a descending order with the last element in path.  
It also skips the current element if it has already been used in the current recursive call (tracked by the used array). The offset of 100 in the index for used is to handle negative numbers since array indices cannot be negative.  

Recursive Calls and Backtracking:  
If the current element passes the checks, it is added to path, marked as used in the used array, and backtrack is recursively called with the next index (i + 1).  
After returning from the recursive call, the element is removed from path (backtracking), and the usage flag is reset (though resetting is not shown, it's implied as each level of recursion has its own used array).  

Execution:  
The initial call to backtrack starts from index 0, attempting to build subsequences from the start of the array.  

Summary:  
This method systematically explores all potential non-decreasing subsequences of an array that have at least two elements. It uses a backtracking approach complemented by a mechanism to avoid duplicates within the same recursion level through a frequency array (used). This ensures that the solution set does not contain duplicate subsequences and respects the problem constraints of subsequences being non-decreasing and containing at least two elements.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<List<Integer>> result;
    private List<Integer> path;

    public List<List<Integer>> findSubsequences(int[] nums) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        path = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(nums, 0);

        return result;
    }

    public void backtrack(int[] nums, int startIndex){
        if(path.size() >= 2){
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
        }
        int[] used = new int[201];
        for(int i = startIndex; i < nums.length; i++){
            if(!path.isEmpty() && path.get(path.size() - 1) > nums[i]){
                continue;
            }
            else if(used[nums[i] + 100] != 0){
                continue;
            }
            else{
                path.add(nums[i]);
                used[nums[i] + 100] = 1;
                backtrack(nums, i + 1);
                path.removeLast();
            }
        }
        return;
    }
}
