## Question:

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.  

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.  

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.  

Example 1:  

Input: n = 4  
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]  

Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 1  
Output: [["Q"]]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= n <= 9

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.

The Java code provided is an implementation of the N-Queens problem, which finds all possible solutions for placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. Here's a brief overview of the design approach:  

Initialization:  
result is initialized as an ArrayList to store the list of valid chessboard configurations.  
chessboard is initialized as a 2D character array, with all positions set to '.' representing an empty space.  

Backtracking Function (backtrack):  
Recursively tries to place queens row by row. The function takes the current row and the total number of rows n as arguments.  
If row equals n, it means queens have been successfully placed on all rows, and the current configuration is added to the result list by calling generateResult().  

Validation (isValid):  
Checks if a queen can be placed at the position (row, col) without being threatened by another queen.  
It checks vertically in the column and diagonally on both sides to ensure no other queen is in the threatening position.  

Generating Result (generateResult):  
Converts the current state of the chessboard into a list of strings and adds it to the results.  

This approach uses backtracking to explore all potential placements for each queen, immediately pruning paths that would lead to conflicts based on the established rules of how queens threaten each other in chess. This ensures an efficient exploration of the solution space.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<List<String>> result;
    private char[][] chessboard;

    public List<List<String>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        chessboard = new char[n][n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                chessboard[i][j] = '.';
            }
        }

        backtrack(0, n);

        return result;
    }

    public void backtrack(int row, int n){
        if(row == n){
            result.add(generateResult());
            return;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(isValid(row, i, n)){
                chessboard[row][i] = 'Q';
                backtrack(row + 1, n);
                chessboard[row][i] = '.';
            }
        }
        return;
    }

    public boolean isValid(int row, int col, int n){

        for(int i = 0; i < row; i++){
            if(chessboard[i][col] == 'Q') return false;
        }

        for(int i = row - 1, j = col - 1; i >= 0 && j >= 0; i--, j--){
            if(chessboard[i][j] == 'Q') return false;
        }

        for(int i = row - 1, j = col + 1; i >=0 && j < n; i--, j++){
            if(chessboard[i][j] == 'Q') return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    public List<String> generateResult(){
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for(char[] c : chessboard){
            list.add(String.copyValueOf(c));
        }
        return list;
    }
}
