## Question:

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.  

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.   

Example 1:  

Input: n = 4  
Output: 2  

Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown.  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 1  
Output: 1  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= n <= 9

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.

The provided Java code is an implementation of the N-Queens II problem, which calculates the number of possible solutions for placing n queens on an n x n chessboard where no two queens can attack each other. Here's a brief overview of the solution:  

Initialization:  
result is an integer used to count the total number of valid solutions.  
chessboard is a 2D boolean array initialized to false, representing an empty chessboard where false indicates an unoccupied cell.  

Backtracking Algorithm (backtrack method):  
This method is a recursive function that attempts to place queens row by row.  
The base case checks if the row index row is equal to n, indicating that queens have been successfully placed in all rows. In this case, the result counter is incremented.  
It iteratively tries to place a queen in each column of the current row. If placing the queen at (row, col) is valid, it proceeds to the next row.  
After exploring deeper recursive calls, it backtracks by setting chessboard[row][i] back to false, undoing the move to explore other possibilities.  

Validation Check (isValid method):  
This method checks if a queen can be placed at the (row, col) position without being attacked by other queens.  
It checks three directions for threats: vertically above, diagonally left above, and diagonally right above.  
If any queens are found in these directions, the position is not valid for a new queen.  

Returning the Result:  
After exploring all possible placements, the totalNQueens method returns the result, which contains the count of all valid configurations.  

The algorithm efficiently explores all configurations using backtracking by immediately cutting off branches of the search tree where a conflict is detected, which significantly reduces the number of possibilities to consider. This is a classic example of using backtracking for combinatorial problem-solving, where constraints are strictly enforced to prune the search space.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private int result;
    private boolean[][] chessboard;
    public int totalNQueens(int n) {
        result = 0;
        chessboard = new boolean[n][n];

        backtrack(0, n);

        return result;
    }

    public void backtrack(int row, int n){
        if(row == n){
            result++;
            return;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(isValid(row, i, n)){
                chessboard[row][i] = true;
                backtrack(row + 1, n);
                chessboard[row][i] = false;
            }
        }
        
        return;
    }

    public boolean isValid(int row, int col, int n){
        for(int i = 0; i < row; i++){
            if(chessboard[i][col]) return false;
        }

        for(int i = row - 1, j = col - 1; i >= 0 && j>= 0; i--, j--){
            if(chessboard[i][j]) return false;
        }

        for(int i = row - 1, j = col + 1; i >= 0 && j < n; i--, j++){
            if(chessboard[i][j]) return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
