## Question: 

Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].

You may return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 4, k = 2  
Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]  

Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.  
Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.  

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, k = 1  
Output: [[1]]  

Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.  

Constraints:  

1 <= n <= 20  
1 <= k <= n

## Thought: 
We use backTrack to do it. The base case is that when the current arraylist's size is equal to k, we add it to the result. We need set a current number to track the 
progress. The recursive case is that we first add the current number into the arraylist and we do the backTrack with current number + 1. After that we delete the last 
number in the arraylist. We call the backTrack with current number as 1. Then we return the result.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<List<Integer>> result;
    private List<Integer> currentList;

    public List<List<Integer>> combine(int n, int k) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        currentList = new ArrayList<>();

        backTrack(n, k, 1);

        return result;
    }

    private void backTrack(int n, int k, int currentNum){
        if(k == currentList.size()){
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(currentList));
            return;
        }
        else{
            for(int i = currentNum; i <= n; i++){
                currentList.add(i);
                backTrack(n, k, i + 1);
                currentList.remove(currentList.size() - 1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n * k)  
Space complexity: O(k)
