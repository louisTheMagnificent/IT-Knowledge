## Question:

Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).  

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3]  
Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [0]  
Output: [[],[0]]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 10  
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10  
All the numbers of nums are unique.

## Thought: 
We use backtrack to do it.

The Java code provided defines a solution to generate all possible subsets (the power set) of a given array of integers. The solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all combinations of the array elements. Here's a summary of the algorithm's design:  

Initialization:  
result: An ArrayList of List<Integer> that will store all the subsets of the input array.  
curr: An ArrayList of Integer used to keep track of the current subset being explored.  

Base Case for Adding Subsets:  
Initially, the empty subset (curr) is added to result before any backtracking starts, as the empty set is a subset of any set.  

Backtracking Method (backtrack):  
The method backtrack is called with the initial array nums, and the starting index set to 0.  
It iteratively explores each element of the array starting from the startIndex to include in the current subset.  

Recursive Exploration:  
For each element in the array from startIndex to the end of the array:  
The element at the current index i is added to curr, which represents the current subset.  
This updated version of curr is then added to result as a new subset.  
The method then recursively calls itself to explore further elements that can be added to the current subset, incrementing startIndex to i + 1 to ensure elements are only considered once.  
After the recursive call returns, the last element added to curr is removed (backtracking), allowing the loop to proceed to the next element and explore different combinations.  

Termination and Result Compilation:  
The recursion ensures that once all elements have been considered starting from a particular startIndex, the function returns, eventually compiling all possible subsets into result.  
The process systematically explores all combinations of the array elements by building up subsets incrementally and then dismantling them step by step (backtracking), ensuring that all combinations are captured.  

Summary:  
This method effectively generates all subsets of an array by using a backtracking approach that systematically builds up subsets, adds them to the result list, and then backtracks to explore new possibilities. It leverages the simplicity and power of recursion to handle the combinatorial complexity of subset generation efficiently.

## Solution:  
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<List<Integer>> result;
    private List<Integer> curr;
    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        curr = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(curr);

        backtrack(nums, 0);

        return result;
    }

    public void backtrack(int[] nums, int startIndex){

        for(int i = startIndex; i < nums.length; i++){
            curr.add(nums[i]);
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(curr));
            backtrack(nums, i + 1);
            curr.removeLast();
        }

        return;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n * 2<sup>n</sup>)  
Space complexity: O(n)
