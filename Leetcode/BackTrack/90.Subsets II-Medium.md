## Question:

Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set).  

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,2,2]  
Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [0]  
Output: [[],[0]]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 10  
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.

The Java code provided defines a solution to generate all possible subsets of a given array of integers where the array may contain duplicates. This solution uses a backtracking approach to explore all combinations, ensuring that duplicates do not lead to redundant subsets. Hereâ€™s a summary of the algorithm's design:  

Initialization:  
result: An ArrayList of List<Integer> that stores all unique subsets.  
path: An ArrayList of Integer used to track the current subset being built.  

Preprocessing:  
The input array nums is sorted to facilitate the handling of duplicates. Sorting helps in easily identifying and skipping duplicates during the subset construction.  

Backtracking Method (backtrack):  
The method starts by adding the current state of path to result, which means each recursive call adds the current subset to the result list before considering additional elements.  
It iterates over the array elements starting from the given startIndex, allowing for the construction of subsets that include the current element.  

Recursive Exploration:  
Inside the loop:  
The current number nums[i] is added to path.  
The method recursively calls itself with the next index (i + 1) to explore subsets that include the next elements.  
After returning from the recursive call, the last element is removed from path (this is the backtracking step), resetting the subset to its previous state.  
To handle duplicates: If the next element in the array is the same as the current one (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]), the loop skips it. This skip happens after the recursive call and before the increment in the loop, preventing the inclusion of duplicate subsets starting with the same sequence of numbers.  

Result Compilation:  
The method ensures that each subset, including those that could be affected by the presence of duplicates, is added only once to result due to the conditional skip of duplicates.  

Summary:  
This method efficiently generates all unique subsets from a potentially duplicate-containing array by leveraging a sorted array and a backtracking approach with a specific check to skip over duplicates. This design ensures that all possible unique subsets are explored without redundancy, capturing the combinatorial possibilities in a systematic and efficient manner.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    private List<List<Integer>> result;
    private List<Integer> path;

    public List<List<Integer>> subsetsWithDup(int[] nums) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        path = new ArrayList<>();
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        backtrack(nums, 0);

        return result;    
    }

    public void backtrack(int[] nums, int startIndex){
        result.add(new ArrayList<>(path));

        for(int i = startIndex; i < nums.length; i++){
            path.add(nums[i]);
            backtrack(nums, i + 1);
            path.removeLast();
            while(i < nums.length - 1 && nums[i] == nums[i + 1]){
                i++;
            }
        }

        return;
    }
}
```
