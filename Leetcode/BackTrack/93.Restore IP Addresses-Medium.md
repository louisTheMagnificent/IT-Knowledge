## Question:

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.  

For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses, but "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.  
Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into s. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in s. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "25525511135"  
Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "0000"  
Output: ["0.0.0.0"]  

Example 3:  

Input: s = "101023"  
Output: ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]  

Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 20  
s consists of digits only.

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it.


The Java code provided is designed to solve the problem of restoring valid IP addresses from a given string. The solution uses a backtracking approach to explore all possible segmentations of the string into parts that could represent valid IP address segments. Hereâ€™s a summary of the algorithm's design:  

Initialization:  
result: An ArrayList of Strings to store valid IP addresses found.  
curr: An ArrayList of StringBuilder objects, used to hold the current segments being considered for forming an IP address.  

Early Return for Invalid Cases:  
If the string's length is less than 4 or more than 12, it's impossible to form a valid IP address, so the method returns an empty list immediately.  

Backtracking Method (backtrack):  
The method backtrack is a recursive function designed to explore potential segmentations of the input string s:  
start: The starting index in the string s from which to consider segments.  
sb: A StringBuilder used to accumulate characters for the current segment.  

Recursive Exploration:  
Base Case: If the start index equals the length of the string and exactly four segments have been successfully created, concatenate these segments into a valid IP address format and add it to the result list.  
Iteratively consider each possible segment of up to three characters (since valid IP segments range from 0 to 255).  
Break out of the loop if:  
The current index exceeds the length of the string.  
Not enough characters remain in the string to complete four segments.  
The current segment fails the validity check defined by the check method.  

Checking Validity of a Segment (check):  
Checks if a StringBuilder segment is a valid IP address part:  
It handles cases where segments start with a '0' (valid only if the segment is exactly '0').  
Converts the StringBuilder to an integer to check if it's within the 0 to 255 range.  

Add/Remove Segments:  
On passing the validity check, add the current segment sb to curr.  
Recurse to the next part of the string.  
On returning from deeper recursion (backtracking), remove the last added segment to try different segmentations.  

Result Compilation:  
After all possibilities are explored, return the result containing all valid IP addresses.  

Summary:  
The provided solution methodically explores all possible ways to split the string s into segments that conform to IP address rules, using a backtracking approach that ensures all combinations are considered. It leverages efficient checks and conditions to avoid unnecessary computations and ensures correctness by validating each potential segment before deeper

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    
    private List<String> result;
    private List<StringBuilder> curr;
    public List<String> restoreIpAddresses(String s) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        curr = new ArrayList<>();
        if(s.length() > 12 || s.length() < 4) return result;

        backtrack(s, 0, new StringBuilder());

        return result;
    }

    public void backtrack(String s, int start, StringBuilder sb){
        

        if(start == s.length()){
            StringBuilder outcome = new StringBuilder();
            int i = 0;
            while(i < curr.size()){
                outcome.append(curr.get(i));
                if(i == 3) break; 
                else outcome.append('.');
                i++;
            }
            result.add(outcome.toString());
            return;
        }

        for(int i = start; i < start + 3; i++){
            if(i == s.length()) break;
            if(s.length() - i < 4 - curr.size()) break;
            sb.append(s.charAt(i));
            if(!check(sb)) break;
            else{
                if(curr.size() == 4) break;
                curr.add(sb);
                backtrack(s, i + 1, new StringBuilder());
                curr.removeLast();
            }
        }

        return;
    }

    public boolean check(StringBuilder sb){
        if(sb.charAt(0) == '0' && sb.length() == 1) return true;
        if(sb.charAt(0) == '0' && sb.length() > 1) return false;

        int ip = Integer.parseInt(sb.toString());
        if(ip > 0 && ip < 256) return true;
        else return false;
    }
}
```
