## Question: 

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.  

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.  

Example 1:

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]  
Output: true  

Example 2:


Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]  
Output: false  

Example 3:  

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]  
Output: false  

Constraints:  

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].  
-104 <= Node.val <= 104  

---
## Thought:
We use recursion to do it. The base case is that if both nodes are null, return true. The recursive case is that if p is not null and 
q is not null and q.val == p.val, we return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right). Else we return false.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(p == null && q == null) return true;
        
        if(p != null && q != null && p.val == q.val){
            return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(Height of the tree)
