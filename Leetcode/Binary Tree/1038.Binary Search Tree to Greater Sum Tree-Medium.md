## Question:

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.  

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:  

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.  
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.    
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.  
 
Example 1:  

Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]  
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [0,null,1]  
Output: [1,null,1]  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].  
0 <= Node.val <= 100  
All the values in the tree are unique.

## Thought: 
This question is the same as the question 538.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode bstToGst(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode curr = root;
        TreeNode prev = null;
        while(curr != null){
            if(curr.right == null){
                if(prev != null){
                    curr.val = prev.val + curr.val;
                }
                prev = curr;
                curr = curr.left;
            }
            else{
                TreeNode predecessor = curr.right;
                while(predecessor.left != null && predecessor.left != curr){
                    predecessor = predecessor.left;
                }
                if(predecessor.left == null){
                    predecessor.left = curr;
                    curr = curr.right;
                }
                else{
                    predecessor.left = null;
                    if(prev != null){
                        curr.val = curr.val + prev.val;
                    }
                    prev = curr;
                    curr = curr.left;
                }
            }
        }
        return root;        
    }
}
```
