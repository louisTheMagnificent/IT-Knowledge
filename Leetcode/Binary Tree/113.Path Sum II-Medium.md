## Question: 

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22  
Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]  

Explanation: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:  
5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22  
5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22  

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5  
Output: []  

Example 3:  

Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0  
Output: []  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].  
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000  
-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

## Thought:
We use backtrack to do it based on DFS. We initialize two list. One is for the return, and the other is for tracking path. We start at the root.
If root is null we return directly. If not null, we use targetSum to subtract current value and add the value to the path. If the current node is leaf, we check if 
the targetSum is 0. If so, it means we find a path. Then we add the path to the result list. If left child is not null, we do the same thing to the left child. We do
so to the right one if it is not null as well. After we finish the access of one node, we delete it from the last value of the path. After we traverse the whole tree, 
we get all the path in the result list.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> pathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> current = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        DFS(root, targetSum, result, current);
        return result;
    }

    private void DFS(TreeNode root, int targetSum, List<List<Integer>>result, List<Integer> current){
        if(root == null) return;
        targetSum -= root.val;
        current.add(root.val);
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null){
            if(targetSum == 0){
                result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
            }
        }

        if(root.left != null){
            DFS(root.left, targetSum, result, current);
        }

        if(root.right != null){
            DFS(root.right, targetSum, result, current);
        }
        current.remove(current.size() - 1);
    }
}
