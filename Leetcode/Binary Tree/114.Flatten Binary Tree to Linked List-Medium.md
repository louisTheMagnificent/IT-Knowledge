## Question: 

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":  

The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.  
The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.  

Example 1:  

Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]  
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]  

Example 2:  

Input: root = []  
Output: []  

Example 3:  

Input: root = [0]  
Output: [0]  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].  
-100 <= Node.val <= 100  
 
Follow up: Can you flatten the tree in-place (with O(1) extra space)?

## Thought: 

This Java code is designed to flatten a binary tree into a linked list using the tree's right pointers. The function directly manipulates the tree structure without using additional space for recursion or data structures. Hereâ€™s how the code achieves this:  

Check for Null: The function starts by checking if the root node is null. If it is, the function returns immediately as there's nothing to process.  

Traversal and Reconnection:  
The function iterates over the tree nodes starting from the root using a curr pointer.  
For each node that has a left child, the function finds the rightmost node of the left subtree.  
It then connects the rightmost node's right pointer to the current node's right child.  
The entire left subtree is then moved to the right of the current node.  
The left pointer of the current node is set to null, effectively removing the original left subtree.  

Advance to Next Node: After restructuring the current node, the function advances to the next node along the right, continuing the process until all nodes are visited.  

The method works in-place, transforming the tree into a right-skewed form that represents the linked list, following the order of a preorder traversal. This approach is efficient in terms of space as it does not require additional memory beyond the input tree structure.

## Solution: 
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return;
        TreeNode curr = root;
        while(curr != null){
            if(curr.left != null){
                TreeNode last = curr.left;
                while(last.right != null){
                    last = last.right;
                }
                last.right = curr.right;
                curr.right = curr.left;
                curr.left = null;
            }
            curr = curr.right;
        }
        return;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
