## Question:  

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

Example 1:  
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6  

Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:

Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42  

Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].  
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Thought:   
At every parent node, there can be tree possible path:  
1.The node itself  
2.The node plus maximum of left/right subtree's path  
3.The node plus left subtree's path and rigth subtree's path  
Pick the maximum out of these 3 possible path, repeat this for every node and keep updating the maxSum.  
Also at every node return the current path sum (maximum of node.val and node.val combined with max of subtree's path) to be considered as one of the 2 subtrees' path for its parent.

In case of null nodes at the end, 0 will be returned as the current pathSum.

## Solution: 
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        int sum = traverse(root);
        return maxSum;
    }
    public int traverse(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null){
            return 0;
        }
        int left = traverse(root.left);
        int right = traverse(root.right);
        int maxChildSum = Math.max(left, right);
        int maxPathSum = Math.max(root.val, maxChildSum + root.val);
        int currentMaxSum = Math.max(maxPathSum, root.val + right + left);
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentMaxSum);
        return maxPathSum;
    }
}
```  
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(Height of the tree)
