## Question:

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1  
Output: 1  
Example 2:  

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3  
Output: 3  

Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is n.  
1 <= k <= n <= 104  
0 <= Node.val <= 104  

Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and 
you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

## Thought:
We use Morris Traversal to do it. We set a index to count how many nodes we have traversed until we traversed the Kth node.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int kthSmallest(TreeNode root, int k) {
        int traversedNum = 0;
        TreeNode curr = root;

        while(curr != null){
            if(curr.left == null){
                traversedNum++;
                if(traversedNum == k) return curr.val;
                curr = curr.right;
            }
            else{
                TreeNode predecessor = curr.left;
                while(predecessor.right != null && predecessor.right != curr){
                    predecessor = predecessor.right;
                }
                if(predecessor.right == null){
                    predecessor.right = curr;
                    curr = curr.left;
                }
                else{
                    predecessor.right = null;
                    traversedNum++;
                    if(traversedNum == k) return curr.val;
                    curr = curr.right;
                }
            }
        }
        return curr.val;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(k)  
Space complexity: O(1)

## Follow up:
If the BST is modified often and you need to frequently find the kth smallest element, consider the following approach:  
1. Augment the TreeNode Class: Add an additional property int count to each node representing the count of nodes in the subtree rooted at this node.
2. Update Operations: Whenever you insert or delete a node, update the count properties of all ancestors of the modified node, so each nodeâ€™s count reflects the current number of nodes in its subtree.
3. Query Operation: To find the kth smallest, use the count properties: Compare k with the count of the left subtree: If k is less than or equal to the left count, go left. If k is greater, subtract the left count plus one (for the current node) from k, and go right.

This method allows finding the kth smallest element in logarithmic time relative to the height of the tree, which is optimal for balanced BSTs and the time complexity is O(Height of the tree).
