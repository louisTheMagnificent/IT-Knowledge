## Question:

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.  

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:  

Search for a node to remove.  
If the node is found, delete the node.  
 
Example 1:  

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3  
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]  

Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.  
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.  
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0  
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]  

Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.  

Example 3:  

Input: root = [], key = 0  
Output: []  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].  
-105 <= Node.val <= 105  
Each node has a unique value.  
root is a valid binary search tree.  
-105 <= key <= 105  
 
Follow up: Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?

## Thought:

We use recursion to do it.

The deleteNode method in the Solution class deletes a node with a specified key from a Binary Search Tree (BST) while maintaining its properties. Here’s a simplified breakdown:  

Base Case: If root is null, return null since the tree is empty or the node isn’t found.  

Locate Node:  
If key < root.val, recurse into the left subtree.  
If key > root.val, recurse into the right subtree.  

Delete Node:  
If the node is found (key == root.val):  
No children: Return null to remove the node.  
One child: Return the non-null child to replace the node.  
Two children: Replace the node with its in-order successor (smallest node in the right subtree), ensuring that the left subtree of the deleted node is attached to this successor.  
Return Updated Tree: Return root which may be updated if the deletion occurs deeper in the tree.

This approach ensures that the BST's structural and order properties are preserved after deletion.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode deleteNode(TreeNode root, int key) {
        if(root == null) return root;

        if(key < root.val) root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);

        else if(key > root.val) root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);

        else{
            if(root.left == null && root.right == null) return null;
            else{
                if(root.right != null){
                    TreeNode curr = root.right;
                    while(curr.left != null){
                        curr = curr.left;
                    }
                    curr.left = root.left;
                    root = root.right;
                }
                else root = root.left;
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(Height of the tree)  
Space complexity: O(1)
