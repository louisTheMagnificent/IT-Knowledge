## Question:

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.  

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.  

Assume a BST is defined as follows:  

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.  
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.  
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.  
 
Example 1:  

Input: root = [1,null,2,2]  
Output: [2]  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [0]  
Output: [0]  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].  
-105 <= Node.val <= 105  
 
Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

## Thought:
We use morris traversal to do it.

This Java code defines a class named Solution that includes a method called findMode to find the most frequently occurring elements in a binary search tree. The method uses Morris Inorder traversal to optimize space complexity, avoiding the use of recursion stack. Here is a summary of the algorithm's design:  

Initialization: It uses curr to traverse the current node of the tree, prev to record the previously visited node, list to store elements with the highest frequency, currMax to record the current highest frequency, and count to count the occurrences of the current element.  

Morris Inorder Traversal: The tree is traversed such that if the left child of the current node curr is null, the current node is directly accessed and compared with the previous node prev:  
If curr and prev have the same value, count is incremented.  
If different, count and currMax are compared. If count is greater, currMax is updated, list is cleared, and the value of prev is added. If count equals currMax, the value of prev is added to list.  

Handling Left Subtree: If curr has a left child, find the rightmost node in the left subtree (i.e., the predecessor of curr), make its right pointer point to curr (creating a temporary link), and then move curr to its left child.  

Backtracking to the Right Subtree: If the predecessor's right pointer already points to curr (indicating the left subtree has been visited), the temporary link is broken, and the current node is processed according to the inorder sequence, then moving to the right subtree.  

End of Traversal: After the traversal, check if the last node's count needs to update list and currMax.  

Output the Result: The elements in list are transferred to the array result, which is then returned.  

This algorithm uses Morris traversal to navigate through the binary tree in constant space, while effectively tracking and updating the elements with the highest frequency using list and currMax.
