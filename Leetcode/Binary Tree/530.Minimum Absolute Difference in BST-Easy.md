## Question:

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree. 

Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]  
Output: 1  

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]  
Output: 1  

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 104].  
0 <= Node.val <= 105  

---
## Thought:
We use Morris Traversal to do it. We can find previous node and current node. We calculate the difference and renew it if the current one is 
smaller than the one we record before.

---
## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

        int diff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        while(curr != null){
            if(curr.left == null){
                if(prev != null && curr.val - prev.val < diff){
                    diff = curr.val - prev.val;
                }
                prev = curr;
                curr = curr.right;        
            }
            else{
                TreeNode predecessor = curr.left;
                while(predecessor.right != null && predecessor.right != curr){
                    predecessor = predecessor.right;
                }
                if(predecessor.right == null){
                    predecessor.right = curr;
                    curr = curr.left;
                }
                else if(predecessor.right == curr){
                    predecessor.right = null;
                    if(prev != null && curr.val - prev.val < diff){
                        diff = curr.val - prev.val;
                    }
                    prev = curr;
                    curr = curr.right;                     
                }
            }
        }
        return diff;
    }
}
