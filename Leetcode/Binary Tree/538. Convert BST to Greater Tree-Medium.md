## Question:

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.  

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:  

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.  
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.  
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.  
 
Example 1:  

Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]  
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [0,null,1]  
Output: [1,null,1]  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].  
-104 <= Node.val <= 104  
All the values in the tree are unique.  
root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.

## Thought:

We use reverse morris traversal to do it.  

This Java code defines a method convertBST in the Solution class that converts a binary search tree (BST) into a greater tree where each node contains the original value plus the sum of all nodes greater than it. The method uses a reverse in-order traversal approach leveraging the Morris Traversal technique for space efficiency. Here’s a summary of the algorithm's design:  

Initialization: Variables curr and prev are used to navigate the tree and accumulate values, respectively. curr starts at the root of the tree.  

Morris Traversal:  
Traverse the tree using Morris Traversal, which avoids recursion and auxiliary data structures (like stacks) by using temporary links between nodes.  

Reverse In-Order Traversal:  
If curr.right is null, it means there is no greater node to the right, and curr can be updated based on prev. If prev is not null, update curr.val with curr.val + prev.val. Then, move to the left child (curr = curr.left).  
If curr.right is not null, find the in-order successor of curr in its right subtree (the leftmost node in the right subtree, predecessor). If this successor’s left link is null, set this link to curr, indicating that the traversal will return here after processing the right subtree, and move to curr.right.  
If the temporary left link of the successor (back to curr) exists, it means curr’s right subtree has been processed. Update curr.val with the sum of its value and prev.val if prev is not null, reset the temporary link, and proceed to curr.left.  

Completion:  
The traversal and updates continue until curr is null, indicating all nodes have been processed. The tree now reflects the greater tree structure, where each node contains its original value plus the sum of all greater nodes.  

Return the Modified Tree:  
Finally, return the modified root of the tree.  
This method transforms the BST into a greater tree by using Morris Traversal for efficient space usage and handles the modifications during the traversal without requiring additional memory for the recursion stack or other structures.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {

    public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode curr = root;
        TreeNode prev = null;
        while(curr != null){
            if(curr.right == null){
                if(prev != null){
                    curr.val = prev.val + curr.val;
                }
                prev = curr;
                curr = curr.left;
            }
            else{
                TreeNode predecessor = curr.right;
                while(predecessor.left != null && predecessor.left != curr){
                    predecessor = predecessor.left;
                }
                if(predecessor.left == null){
                    predecessor.left = curr;
                    curr = curr.right;
                }
                else{
                    predecessor.left = null;
                    if(prev != null){
                        curr.val = curr.val + prev.val;
                    }
                    prev = curr;
                    curr = curr.left;
                }
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
}
