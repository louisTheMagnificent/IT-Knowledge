## Question:

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.  

Example 1:  

Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]  
Output: 1  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]  
Output: 1  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 100].  
0 <= Node.val <= 105

## Thought:
This question is the same as Question 530.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

    public int minDiffInBST(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode curr = root;
        TreeNode prev = null;
        int diff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        while(curr != null){
            if(curr.left == null){
                if(prev != null){
                    diff = Math.min(diff, curr.val - prev.val);
                }
                prev = curr;
                curr = curr.right;
            }
            else{
                TreeNode predecessor = curr.left;
                while(predecessor.right != null && predecessor.right != curr){
                    predecessor = predecessor.right;
                }
                if(predecessor.right == null){
                    predecessor.right = curr;
                    curr = curr.left;
                }
                else{
                    predecessor.right = null;
                    if(prev != null){
                        diff = Math.min(diff, curr.val - prev.val);
                    }
                    prev = curr;
                    curr = curr.right;
                }
            }
        }

        return diff;        
    }
}
