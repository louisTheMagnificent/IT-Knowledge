## Question:  

Given the root node of a binary search tree and two integers low and high, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range [low, high].

Example 1:

Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
Output: 32  

Explanation: Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.  

Example 2:

Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], low = 6, high = 10
Output: 23  

Explanation: Nodes 6, 7, and 10 are in the range [6, 10]. 6 + 7 + 10 = 23.  

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2 * 104].  
1 <= Node.val <= 105  
1 <= low <= high <= 105  
All Node.val are unique.

## Thought:
We choose the recursion to solve the problem. If the current node's value is in the range, we add it to the sum. If it is larger, we go to the left subtree. If it is smaller, we go to the right subtree. Finally we sum up the left subtree's sum, right subtree's sum and current value as current node's sum.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
    if(root == null) return 0;
    if(root.val > high) return rangeSumBST(root.left, low, high);
    if(root.val < low) return rangeSumBST(root.right, low, high);
    return root.val + rangeSumBST(root.left, low, high) + rangeSumBST(root.right, low, high);
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(N)  
Space complexity: O(Height of the tree)
