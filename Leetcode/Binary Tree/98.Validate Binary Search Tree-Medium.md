## Question: 

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.  
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.  
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.  

Example 1:

Input: root = [2,1,3]  
Output: true  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]  
Output: false  

Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].  
-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1

## Thought:
In order to do it with O(1) space complexity, we use Morris Traversal to do it. It is fulfiled with plenty of blank pointers. First 
we check if the current node has left child. If so, find the rightmost node of its left subtree. Set its right child as current node. Then we go the 
current left child. When we reach the leftmost node, if the prev node is null, set it as the leftmost node and current node goes right. If not null, check the current node's value with 
the prev's. If prev's is not smaller than the current's, return false. If not, set prev as current and current as its right child. 
When the rightmost node we found previously was detected to have current node as its new right child, delete its right child and check the current node's value with 
the prev's. If prev's is not smaller than the current's, return false. If not, set prev as current and current as its right child. We do it until current 
node is null. Then return true.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode current = root;
        TreeNode prev = null;
        TreeNode predecessor;

        while (current != null) {
            if(current.left == null){
                if(prev != null && prev.val >= current.val){
                    return false;
                }
                prev = current;
                current = prev.right;
            }
            else{
                predecessor = current.left;
                while(predecessor.right != null && predecessor.right != current){
                    predecessor = predecessor.right;
                }

                if(predecessor.right == null){
                    predecessor.right = current;
                    current = current.left;
                }
                else{
                    predecessor.right = null;
                    if(prev != null && prev.val >= current.val){
                        return false;
                    }
                    prev = current;
                    current = prev.right;                    
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(1)
