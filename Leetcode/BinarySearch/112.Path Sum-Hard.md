## Question:  

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:


Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true  

Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.  

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false  

Explanation: There are two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:  
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.  
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.  
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.  

Example 3:

Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
Output: false  

Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].  
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000  
-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

## Thought:  
We choose the thought of recursion to solve the problem. We first go to the root node. Use targetSum to minus the current value
as currentSum. Then we go to check its child node with currentSum as a new targetSum. If there is a path via one of the two children 
nodes, it will be ok. When the node is null, we return false. We only return true when we reached the leaf node and currentSum is 0;

## Solution:  
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) {        
        if(root == null){
            return false;
        }
        int currentSum = targetSum - root.val;
        if(currentSum == 0 && root.left == null && root.right == null){
            return true;
        }
        return (hasPathSum(root.left, currentSum) || hasPathSum(root.right, currentSum));
    }
}
```  
Time complexity: O(N)(The tree is not balanced)  
Space complexity: O(Height of the tree)
