## Question:

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2  

Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.  

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5  

Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

## Thought:  

According to the discription, we only need to find the leftmost element which is larger than its right neighbours (if the array is strictly decreasing, the first element is the peak one). We use binary search to implement based on the templete so that we can limit the time complexity within O(logN).

## Solution:  

```Java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = nums.length - 1;
        while(lo <= hi){
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            int right = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            if(mid + 1 < nums.length){
                right = nums[mid + 1];
            }
            if(nums[mid] >= right){
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
            else{
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return lo;
    }
}
```
