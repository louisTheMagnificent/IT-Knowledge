## Question:

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0  
Output: 4  

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3  
Output: -1  

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0  
Output: -1  

Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 5000  
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104  
All values of nums are unique.  
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.  
-104 <= target <= 104

## Thought: 
We still use the binary search template. Although the array is rotated sorted, we can guarantee that a half of the array is sorted. 
We start at the middle. If it is equal to the target, return the position. First we check which part is sorted and based on that part, we can 
make sure which part is the target potentially by comparing the target with the sorted part's first and last number. Keep doing it until 
we find the position or we finish the loop.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = nums.length - 1;
        while(lo <= hi){
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if(nums[mid] == target){
                return mid;
            }
            else{
                if(nums[lo] <= nums[mid]){
                    if(target < nums[mid] && target >= nums[lo]){
                        hi = mid - 1;
                    }
                    else{
                        lo = mid + 1;
                    }
                }
                else{
                    if(target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[hi]){
                        lo = mid + 1;
                    }
                    else{
                        hi = mid - 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(logn)  
Space complexity: O(1)
