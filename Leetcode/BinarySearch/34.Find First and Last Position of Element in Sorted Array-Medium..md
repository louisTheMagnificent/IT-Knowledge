## Question:

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.  

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].  

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8  
Output: [3,4]  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6  
Output: [-1,-1]  

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [], target = 0  
Output: [-1,-1]  
 
Constraints:  

0 <= nums.length <= 105  
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109  
nums is a non-decreasing array.  
-109 <= target <= 109

## Thought:
We use binary search to do it. 
This Java code implements a function to find the starting and ending position of a given target value in a sorted array using a modified binary search algorithm. The main function searchRange initializes the result array with -1, -1, assuming the target is not found. It then calls a helper method binarySearch twice to determine the leftmost and rightmost indices of the target in the array.  
The binarySearch method is designed to perform a standard binary search but is modified to continue searching to the left or right when the target is found, based on the boolean parameter isLeft. This parameter determines whether to narrow the search towards the left (find the first occurrence) or towards the right (find the last occurrence) after finding an instance of the target. If isLeft is true, the search space is adjusted to the left of the found target by setting the high pointer hi to mid - 1. Conversely, if isLeft is false, it focuses on the right by setting the low pointer lo to mid + 1.  
The binary search repeatedly halves the search interval and adjusts the boundaries based on how the middle element compares to the target until it converges on the correct indices or determines that the target is not in the array. After both searches are completed, the function updates the result array with the found indices and returns it. This approach efficiently pinpoints the first and last occurrence of the target in logarithmic time, making it highly effective for large datasets.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] searchRange(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] result = {-1,-1};
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        left = binarySearch(nums, target, true);
        right = binarySearch(nums, target, false);
        result[0] = left;
        result[1] = right;
        return result;
    }

    public int binarySearch(int[] nums, int target, boolean isLeft){
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = nums.length - 1;
        int index = -1;
        while(lo <= hi){
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if(nums[mid] < target){
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
            else if(nums[mid] > target){
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
            else{
                index = mid;
                if(isLeft == true) hi = mid - 1;
                else lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(logn)  
Space complexity: O(1)
