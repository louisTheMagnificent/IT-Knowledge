## Question:

Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.  

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.  

You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.  

Example 1:  

Input: num = 16  
Output: true  

Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.  

Example 2:  

Input: num = 14  
Output: false  
Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.  

Constraints:  

1 <= num <= 231 - 1

## Thought:
We use binary search to do it.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        int hi = num;
        int lo = 0;
        int mid = -1;
        while(lo <= hi){
            mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if((long) mid * mid > (long) num) hi = mid - 1;
            else if((long) mid * mid == (long) num) return true;
            else lo = mid + 1;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(1)
