## Question: 

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:  

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.  

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.  

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:  

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).  
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).  
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).  
Return the number that I picked.  

Example 1:  

Input: n = 10, pick = 6  
Output: 6  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 1, pick = 1  
Output: 1  

Example 3:  

Input: n = 2, pick = 1  
Output: 1  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= n <= 231 - 1  
1 <= pick <= n

## Thought:
We use binary search to do it.This code uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently guess a number between 1 and n. It initializes two pointers, left and right, to represent the search range, and repeatedly calculates the midpoint mid. It then uses the guess API to compare mid with the target number. Based on the result, it narrows the search range by adjusting either left or right. Once the correct number is found (i.e., when guess(mid) == 0), it breaks the loop and returns the result.

## Solution:
```Java
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
 */

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        while(left <= right){
            int mid = (right - left) / 2 + left;
            if(guess(mid) == -1){
                right = mid - 1;
            }
            else if(guess(mid) == 1){
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                result = mid;
                break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(logn)  
Space complexity: O(1)
