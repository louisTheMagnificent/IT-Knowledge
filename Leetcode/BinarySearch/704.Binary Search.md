## Question

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.  

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4  

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1

Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1  

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.

## Thought  

In order to limit the runtime complexity with in O(logN), we choose Binary Search to implement because the array is already sorted. We start from the middle of the array. If the element in the middle is larger than target, it means the target is possible to locate on the left of the middle element and we renew the right bound. If not, we do the opposite things. Keep searching until we find the target or the lower bound is larger than the higher one.

## Solution  

```Java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = nums.length - 1;
        while(lo <= hi){
            int mid = (lo + hi)/2;
            if(nums[mid] == target){
                return mid;
            }
            else if(nums[mid] > target){
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
            else{
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(logN)  
Space complexity: O(1)
