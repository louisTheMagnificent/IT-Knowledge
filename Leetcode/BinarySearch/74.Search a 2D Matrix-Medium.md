## Question:

You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.  
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.  
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.  

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3  
Output: true  

Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13  
Output: false  

Constraints:  

m == matrix.length  
n == matrix[i].length  
1 <= m, n <= 100  
-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104

## Thought: 
We use the binary search template to do it. But we need to convert the 1D position into the 2D one. The vertical axis = mid / n, the 
horizontal axis = mid % n (n is matrix[0].length). Lo = 0, hi = m + n - 1 (m is matrix.length).

---
## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = m * n - 1;
        while(lo <= hi){
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if(matrix[mid / n][mid % n] > target){
                hi = mid - 1;
            } 
            else if(matrix[mid / n][mid % n] < target){
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(log(m * n))  
Space complexity: O(1)
