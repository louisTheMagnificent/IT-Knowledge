## Question:

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.  

Note:  

Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.  
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.  

Example 1:  

Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100  
Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)  

Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101  
Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)  

Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.  

Constraints:  

The input must be a binary string of length 32  
 
Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Thought:
We use bit manipulation to do it.


The provided Java code implements a function to reverse the bits of an unsigned integer. It uses bit manipulation techniques to achieve this:  

Initialization:   
Initializes an integer result to zero to store the reversed bits.  
 
Bit Reversal Process:  
Iterates 32 times for each bit of the input integer n.  
Extracts the least significant bit of n using the bitwise AND operation with 1.  
Appends this bit to result by left-shifting result and using bitwise OR to add the extracted bit.  
Shifts n to the right by one position using the unsigned right shift (>>>) to process the next bit.  

Output:   
After processing all 32 bits, the result contains the reversed bits of n and is returned.  

This method efficiently reverses the bits of the given integer by handling each bit sequentially from least to most significant, thus reversing the order of bits in the output.

## Solution:
```Java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++){
            int bit = n & 1;
            result = (result << 1) | bit;
            n = n >>> 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(1)  
Space complexity: O(1)
