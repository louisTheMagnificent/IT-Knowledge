## Question:

Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).  

Example 1:  

Input: n = 11  

Output: 3  

Explanation:  

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 128  

Output: 1  

Explanation:  

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.  

Example 3:  

Input: n = 2147483645  

Output: 30  

Explanation:  

The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.  

Constraints:  

1 <= n <= 231 - 1  

Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Thought:
We use bit manipulation to do it.

The Java code provided defines a method to calculate the Hamming weight (or the number of 1s in the binary representation) of an unsigned integer. This method is also known as counting the set bits or the population count. Hereâ€™s a summary of how the solution works:  

Method Explanation:  

Function Name: hammingWeight  

Parameters: An integer n, which is treated as an unsigned value.  

Return Value: The count of 1 bits in the binary representation of n.  

Step-by-Step Operation:  

Initialization:  

result: An integer initialized to zero, used to accumulate the count of 1 bits.  

Loop Through the Bits:  
The method uses a while loop to iterate through each bit of n. The loop continues until n becomes zero, indicating there are no more set bits to count.  

Bit Extraction and Count:  

Extract the Least Significant Bit (LSB):  
int bit = n & 1; - This line performs a bitwise AND operation between n and 1. Since 1 in binary is ...0001, this operation isolates the least significant bit of n.  

Count the Bit:  
If bit equals 1, the result counter is incremented. This counts the number of 1s in the binary representation.  

Right Shift the Input:  
n = n >>> 1; - The code uses the unsigned right shift operator (>>>), which shifts the binary representation of n to the right by one bit and fills the leftmost bit with zero. This operation ensures that each bit of the integer is checked without preserving the sign bit, suitable for treating n as an unsigned integer.  

Return the Result:  
After all bits have been processed and counted, the loop ends, and result contains the total count of 1 bits in the original integer n.  

Summary:  
This method effectively counts the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of an unsigned integer using bit manipulation techniques. It processes each bit sequentially, right-shifting n until all bits have been examined, and maintains a count of the 1 bits encountered. This approach is both efficient and straightforward, making it suitable for applications where such a bit count is required.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        while(n != 0){
            int bit = n & 1;
            if(bit == 1) result++;
            n = n >>> 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(1)  
Space complexity: O(1)
