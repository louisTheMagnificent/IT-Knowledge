## Question:

Given two integers left and right that represent the range [left, right], return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.   

Example 1:  

Input: left = 5, right = 7  
Output: 4  

Example 2:  

Input: left = 0, right = 0  
Output: 0  

Example 3:  

Input: left = 1, right = 2147483647  
Output: 0  
 
Constraints:  

0 <= left <= right <= 231 - 1

## Thought:
We use bit manipulation to do it.

The provided Java code defines a method to calculate the bitwise AND of all numbers between two integers, left and right. Hereâ€™s the approach it uses:  

Concept:  
The goal is to find the common bit prefix between left and right. Once the bits differ at any position between the two numbers, all lower bits in the result of the bitwise AND for that range will be 0 because there will be at least one number with a 0 in that bit position within the range.  

Steps to Solve:  

Check for Zero Case:  
If left is 0, the function immediately returns 0. This is because the bitwise AND of any number with 0 is 0, making further calculations unnecessary if the range starts from 0.  

Align the Bits:  
The solution aligns left and right by continuously right-shifting both numbers until they are equal. During each shift, a counter count is incremented to keep track of the number of shifts performed.  

Reconstruct the Number:  
Once left equals right, the loop terminates, and the common prefix found in left (which is now the same as right) is shifted left by count positions. This left shift restores the common prefix to its original bit position, with the lower bits filled with zeros.  

Return Value:  
The function returns left shifted left by count positions, which is the bitwise AND result of all numbers in the specified range.  

Summary:  
This method efficiently calculates the result by leveraging the properties of bitwise operations and focusing on the common prefix of the binary representations of the input numbers. This approach avoids iterating through all numbers in the range and directly computes the result using bit manipulation, ensuring a performance that is logarithmic relative to the number of bits in the numbers.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        if(left == 0) return 0;
        int count = 0;
        while(left != right){
            left >>>= 1;
            right >>>= 1;
            count++;
        }

        return left << count;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(1)  
Space complexity: O(1)
