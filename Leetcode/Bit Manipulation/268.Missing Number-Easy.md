## Question:

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [3,0,1]  

Output: 2  

Explanation:  

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [0,1]  

Output: 2  
 
Explanation:  

n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.  

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]  
 
Output: 8  

Explanation:  

n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

## Thought:
We use xor to do it.

This Java code calculates the missing number from a given array nums which contains n distinct numbers taken from the range 0 to n. Here is a concise overview of the design and logic:  

Design and Logic  

XOR Operation:  
The solution uses the XOR operation to find the missing number. The XOR of a number with itself is 0, and the XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.  

Initialization:  
The variable result is initialized to 0, which will store the final result of the XOR operations.  

XOR all indices:  
The code first XORs result with every index from 1 to nums.length (inclusive). This operation will XOR all possible indices that should be present in the array if no number was missing.  

XOR all array elements:  
Then, the code XORs result with each element in the array nums. This step effectively removes the numbers that are present from the result of the first XOR, leaving only the missing number.  

Return Result:  
After the loops, result will hold the missing number as it will be the only number not cancelled out by the XOR operation.  

Summary  
The XOR operation effectively isolates the missing number by cancelling out all the numbers that appear both as indices and in the array. This method is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and requires constant space O(1), making it an optimal solution for finding a missing number in the given range.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++){
            result ^= i;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            result ^= nums[i];
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
