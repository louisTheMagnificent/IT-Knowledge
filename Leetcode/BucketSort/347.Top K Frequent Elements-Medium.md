## Question:

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2  
Output: [1,2]  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [1], k = 1  
Output: [1]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 105  
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104  
k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].  
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.  
 
Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

## Thought:
We use bucket sorting to do it. This Java code implements a solution for finding the k most frequent elements in an array of integers. The approach used in this code is efficient and leverages data structures like HashMap and arrays of ArrayList.  
The algorithm starts by creating a HashMap to count the frequency of each number in the input array nums. As the array is traversed, each number is added to the HashMap, or its frequency is incremented if it already exists in the map.  
Next, an array of ArrayList, named lists, is initialized where the length of the array is the same as the number of elements in nums. This array is used to group numbers by their frequency. The frequency of each number, subtracted by one to fit zero-based indexing, is used as an index in the lists array, where each number is then added to the corresponding ArrayList.  
Once all numbers are grouped by their frequencies in lists, the code then compiles the result. Starting from the highest possible frequency (the end of the lists array) and moving backwards, it collects numbers until k elements are gathered. Each number is added to the result array, and once k elements are filled, the array is returned.  
If, for any reason, fewer than k elements are found (which theoretically shouldn't happen with valid input according to the problem constraints), an empty array is returned as a safeguard.  
This method ensures that the elements with the highest frequencies are selected efficiently, and by using the frequency as an index, the solution avoids sorting and directly accesses elements in constant time, making it highly efficient for this specific problem.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            map.put(nums[i], map.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);
        }

        List<Integer>[] lists = new ArrayList[nums.length];
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            lists[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        for(Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()){
            int frequency = entry.getValue() - 1;
            lists[frequency].add(entry.getKey());
        }

        int[] result = new int[k];
        int index = 0;
        for(int i = lists.length - 1; i >= 0; i--){
            for(int num : lists[i]){
                result[index++] = num;
                if(index == k){
                    return result;
                }
            }
        }

        return new int[0];
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)
