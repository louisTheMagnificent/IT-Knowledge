## Question:

Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.  

Example 1:  

Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]  
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]  

Example 2:  

Input: preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]  
Output: [-1]  

Constraints:  

1 <= preorder.length <= 3000  
inorder.length == preorder.length  
-3000 <= preorder[i], inorder[i] <= 3000  
preorder and inorder consist of unique values.  
Each value of inorder also appears in preorder.  
preorder is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of the tree.  
inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.

## Thought:
We use DFS to do it.

This Java code snippet is designed to construct a binary tree from given preorder and inorder traversal arrays. It uses a recursive approach facilitated by a mapping of inorder indices for efficient slicing of the arrays during recursive calls. Here's a breakdown of the code's design and functionality:  

Initialization and Mapping:  
The buildTree method initializes a HashMap called map which stores the indices of elements in the inorder array. This mapping is crucial for quick look-up of the root element positions during the recursive tree construction, reducing the time complexity of searching for these positions from O(n) to O(1).  

Base Case for Small Input:  
If the preorder array has only one element, a single-node tree is created and returned, as there's no further division possible.  

Recursive Function findNode:  
This method is where the actual construction of the tree happens. It takes slices of the inorder and preorder arrays defined by inBegin, inEnd, preBegin, and preEnd.  
It first creates a new TreeNode with the value from the start of the current preorder slice, which represents the root of the current subtree due to the properties of preorder traversal (root-node-first).  

Finding Positions and Recursive Construction:  
The root element's index in the inorder array is retrieved from the map. This index splits the inorder array into left and right subtrees.  

Based on the position in the inorder array, corresponding slices of the preorder array are determined:  
The left subtree is built from elements immediately following the current root in preorder up to the count of elements in the left subtree (determined by inOrderPosition - inBegin).  
The right subtree starts just after the left subtree in preorder and continues to the end of the current slice.  

Recursive Calls:  
Recursive calls are made to construct the left child using the left slices of the inorder and preorder arrays and the right child using the right slices.  
The constructed left and right children are assigned to the left and right pointers of the current root node, respectively.  

Completion and Return:  
The recursion completes when the subarray limits cross each other (inBegin >= inEnd or preBegin >= preEnd), which indicates that there are no elements left to construct a subtree, and null is returned.  
For non-null branches, the function returns the newly constructed subtree root, progressively building up the entire tree as the stack unwinds.  

This method leverages the properties of preorder and inorder traversals effectively. In preorder, the root node comes first, which aids in immediate root identification for any subtree. Inorder traversal helps in identifying the extent of left and right subtrees, making it possible to recursively construct the entire tree efficiently. The use of a hashmap for storing inorder indices significantly enhances the speed by allowing constant-time index look-up during tree construction.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {

    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    public TreeNode buildTree(int[] preorder, int[] inorder) {

        for(int i = 0; i < inorder.length; i++){
            map.put(inorder[i], i);
        }

        if(preorder.length == 1) return new TreeNode(preorder[0]);

        return findNode(inorder, 0, inorder.length, preorder, 0, preorder.length);
    }

    public TreeNode findNode(int[] inorder, int inBegin, int inEnd, int[] preorder, int preBegin, int preEnd){
        if(inBegin >= inEnd || preBegin >= preEnd){
            return null;
        }

        TreeNode curr = new TreeNode(preorder[preBegin]);

        int inOrderPosition = map.get(curr.val);

        curr.left = findNode(inorder, inBegin, inOrderPosition, preorder, preBegin + 1, preBegin + 1 + inOrderPosition - inBegin);
        curr.right = findNode(inorder, inOrderPosition + 1, inEnd, preorder, preEnd - inEnd + inOrderPosition + 1, preEnd);

        return curr;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(Height of the tree)
