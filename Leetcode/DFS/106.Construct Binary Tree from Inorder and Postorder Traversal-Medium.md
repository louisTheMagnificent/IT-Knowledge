## Question:

Given two integer arrays inorder and postorder where inorder is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and postorder is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.  

Example 1:  

Input: inorder = [9,3,15,20,7], postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]  
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]  

Example 2:  

Input: inorder = [-1], postorder = [-1]  
Output: [-1]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= inorder.length <= 3000  
postorder.length == inorder.length  
-3000 <= inorder[i], postorder[i] <= 3000  
inorder and postorder consist of unique values.  
Each value of postorder also appears in inorder.  
inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.  
postorder is guaranteed to be the postorder traversal of the tree.

## Thought: 
We use DFS to do it.

This Java code defines a method buildTree for constructing a binary tree from given inorder and postorder traversal arrays. Here's the strategy and methodology explained:  

Initialization:  
The buildTree method initializes the construction by creating the root of the tree from the last element in the postorder array, since the last element in postorder traversal represents the root of the tree.  

Mapping Inorder Indices:  
A HashMap map is used to store each element of the inorder array along with its index. This allows quick lookup of any element's position in the inorder traversal, which is crucial for dividing the tree into left and right subtrees.  

Recursive Tree Construction (findNode method):  
The findNode method is a recursive function designed to construct the tree. It takes slices of the inorder and postorder arrays defined by inBegin, inEnd, postBegin, and postEnd as parameters to manage the current subtree being constructed.  
It stops recursively splitting the arrays into subarrays when inBegin is equal to or greater than inEnd, or postBegin is equal to or greater than postEnd, indicating that there are no more elements to construct nodes from.  

Splitting Logic:  
For each recursive call, the root of the current subtree is identified as the last element of the current postorder slice.  
The index of this root element in the inorder array is retrieved from the map, which divides the inorder array into left and right subtrees.  
The corresponding positions in the postorder array are calculated using the index from the inorder array, enabling the method to recursively construct the left and right children.  

Recursive Construction:  
The tree is constructed recursively by assigning the left child to the result of a recursive call with the left segments of the inorder and postorder arrays, and the right child to the recursive call with the right segments.  
This process is repeated, building the entire tree by systematically creating and connecting all nodes based on the traversal arrays.  
This approach efficiently reconstructs the binary tree by leveraging the properties of inorder and postorder traversals, where the inorder defines the split between left and right subtrees and the postorder identifies the root at each step. The use of a hashmap for index lookup significantly speeds up the reconstruction process by avoiding linear search.

## Solution: 
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    
    private Map<Integer, Integer> map;
    private int currIndex;

    public TreeNode buildTree(int[] inorder, int[] postorder) {
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(postorder[postorder.length - 1]);
        if(postorder.length == 1) return root;
        map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < inorder.length; i++){
            map.put(inorder[i], i);
        }
        
        return findNode(inorder,  0, inorder.length, postorder, 0, postorder.length);
    }

    public TreeNode findNode(int[] inorder, int inBegin, int inEnd, int[] postorder, int postBegin, int postEnd) {
        
        if(inBegin >= inEnd || postBegin >= postEnd) return null;

        TreeNode curr = new TreeNode(postorder[postEnd - 1]);

        int inOrderPosition = map.get(curr.val);

        curr.left = findNode(inorder, inBegin, inOrderPosition, postorder, postBegin, postBegin + inOrderPosition - inBegin);
        curr.right = findNode(inorder, inOrderPosition + 1, inEnd, postorder, postEnd - inEnd + inOrderPosition, postEnd - 1);

        return curr;
        
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(Height of the tree)
