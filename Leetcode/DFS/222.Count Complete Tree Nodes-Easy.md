## Question:

Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.  

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.  

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.  

Example 1:  
 
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]  
Output: 6  

Example 2:  

Input: root = []  
Output: 0  

Example 3:  

Input: root = [1]  
Output: 1  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 104].  
0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104  
The tree is guaranteed to be complete.

## Thought: 
We use DFS to do it based on features of complete tree.  
This Java code defines a method countNodes within a Solution class to calculate the number of nodes in a binary tree using a combination of recursive and iterative approaches:  
Base Case Handling: The method first checks if the given root node is null. If it is, the method returns 0, indicating that there are no nodes in the tree.  
Calculating Heights: The method initializes two pointers, left and right, at the root's left and right children, respectively. It then calculates the height of the leftmost path (leftH) and the rightmost path (rightH) of the tree. These heights are calculated iteratively by traversing down to the leftmost leaf for leftH and to the rightmost leaf for rightH.  
Check for Complete Tree: If the heights of the leftmost and rightmost paths are equal (leftH == rightH), the tree is a perfect binary tree. For a perfect binary tree of height h, the total number of nodes is (2 << h) - 1, which simplifies to 2^(h+1) - 1 using bitwise shift.  
Recursive Calculation: If the tree is not perfect (meaning leftH is not equal to rightH), the method recursively counts the nodes in the left and right subtrees and adds one for the root node. This is summed up as countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right) + 1.  
This solution efficiently leverages the properties of perfect binary trees to optimize node counting, reducing the complexity when applicable, while falling back to a full recursive descent in general cases.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        TreeNode left = root.left;
        TreeNode right = root.right;
        int leftH = 0;
        int rightH = 0;
        while(left != null){
            leftH++;
            left = left.left;
        }
        while(right != null){
            rightH++;
            right = right.right;
        }
        if(leftH == rightH) return (2 << leftH) - 1;

        return countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right) + 1;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(logn)
Space complexity: O(logn)
