## Question:

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.  

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”  

Example 1:  

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8  
Output: 6  

Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4  
Output: 2  

Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.  

Example 3:  

Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1  
Output: 2  

Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].  
-109 <= Node.val <= 109  
All Node.val are unique.  
p != q

## Thought:
We solve this problem with recursion. 

This revised version of the lowestCommonAncestor method in the Solution class specifically addresses the scenario where the binary tree is a Binary Search Tree (BST). The approach leverages the properties of a BST, where the left child nodes have values less than the parent node, and the right child nodes have values greater than the parent node. Here’s how the method works for finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes p and q:  

Base Case for Recursion:  
If the root node’s value is greater than both p's and q's values, this implies that both p and q are located in the left subtree. Therefore, the method recurs into the left subtree: return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q).  
Conversely, if the root node’s value is less than both p's and q's values, this indicates that both nodes are in the right subtree. The method then recurs into the right subtree: return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q).  

Finding the LCA:  
If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that either p equals root, q equals root, or p and q are on different sides of root. This scenario identifies the root as the lowest common ancestor, because it is the lowest node in the tree at which p and q are on different sides.  
The method is efficient for a BST due to the properties of sorted elements, which allow skipping entire subtrees when searching for p and q. It uses the value comparisons to quickly determine the path to both nodes, ensuring an O(h) complexity, where h is the height of the tree. This optimization makes it significantly faster than a general binary tree LCA search in cases where the tree is large and well-balanced.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

class Solution {

    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        if(root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        return root;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(logn) 
Space complexity: O(logn)
p and q will exist in the BST.
