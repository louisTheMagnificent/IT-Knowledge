## Question:

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.  

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”  

Example 1:  

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1  
Output: 3  

Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4  
Output: 5  

Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.  

Example 3:  
 
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2  
Output: 1  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].  
-109 <= Node.val <= 109  
All Node.val are unique.  
p != q

## Thought:
We use postorder traversal to do it.

This Java code defines a method lowestCommonAncestor in the Solution class that is used to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes p and q in a binary tree. The method is a typical example of a recursive approach to solve the LCA problem. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:  

Base Case: If the current node root is null, or if it matches one of the target nodes (p or q), return root. This is because if you hit a null, you've reached the end of a branch, and if you find either p or q, you've found one of the targets.  

Recursive Descent:  
Recur on the left subtree by calling lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q) and store the result in left.  
Recur on the right subtree by calling lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q) and store the result in right.  

Decision Logic:  
If both left and right are null, it means neither subtree contains p or q, so return null.  
If left is not null but right is null, it indicates that all found nodes (p or q) are in the left subtree, so return left.  
Similarly, if right is not null but left is null, it means all found nodes are in the right subtree, so return right.  
If both left and right are not null, it indicates that p and q are found in different subtrees with root as their lowest common ancestor, so return root.  

The beauty of this algorithm lies in its simplicity and effectiveness, leveraging the properties of binary trees and recursion to find the LCA with minimal additional data structures or memory overhead.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        
        if(root == null || root == p || root == q) return root;

        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

        if(left == null && right == null) return null;

        else if(left != null && right == null) return left;

        else if(left == null && right != null) return right;

        else return root;

    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(Height of the tree)   
p and q will exist in the tree.
