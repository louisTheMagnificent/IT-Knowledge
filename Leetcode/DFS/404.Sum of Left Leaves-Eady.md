## Question:

Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.  

A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.  

Example 1:  

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]  
Output: 24  

Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [1]  
Output: 0  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].  
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Thought: 
We use DFS to do it.
The Java code defines a method sumOfLeftLeaves in a Solution class designed to calculate the sum of values of all left leaves in a binary tree. Here's a breakdown of its components and logic:  

Base Case:  
The sumOfLeftLeaves method checks if the root node is null. If it is, it returns 0, as there are no leaves to sum.  

Recursive Function backTrack:  

This helper function is designed to traverse the tree and accumulate the sum of all left leaf nodes. It takes the current node (root) and the accumulated sum as parameters.  
If the current node is null, it returns the current sum, effectively ending that path's contribution to the overall sum.  
The checkLeaf method is called to determine if a node is a leaf (i.e., it has no left or right children).  

Leaf Checking and Summation:
If the left child of the current node is a leaf (verified by checkLeaf), its value is added to the sum.  
If the left child is not a leaf, the function recursively calls itself for both the left and right children. The new sums from these calls (sum1 and sum2) are combined, subtracting the initial sum to avoid double counting.  

Return the Sum:  
The sum is updated recursively as the function traverses through the tree, and the final sum is returned from the initial call to backTrack from sumOfLeftLeaves.  

Leaf Node Check (checkLeaf function):  
This method checks whether a given node is a leaf. It returns true if both left and right child nodes are null, indicating it is a leaf.  

The method effectively traverses the tree, identifies left leaf nodes, and sums their values using recursive traversal, ensuring that all left leaves are considered without double-counting any values.

## Solution: 
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        int sum = 0;
        return backTrack(root, 0);
    }

    public int backTrack(TreeNode root, int sum){
        if(root == null) return sum;
        else if(checkLeaf(root)) return sum;
        if(root.left != null && checkLeaf(root.left)){
            sum += root.left.val;
            sum = backTrack(root.right, sum);
        }
        else{
            int sum1 = backTrack(root.left, sum);
            int sum2 = backTrack(root.right, sum);
            sum = sum1 + sum2 - sum;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public boolean checkLeaf(TreeNode root){
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null) return true;
        return false;
    }
}
