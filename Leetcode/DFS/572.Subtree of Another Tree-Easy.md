## Question:

Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.  

A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.  

Example 1:  

Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]  
Output: true  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]  
Output: false  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000].  
The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000].  
-104 <= root.val <= 104  
-104 <= subRoot.val <= 104

## Thought: 
We use DFS to do it.  
This Java code defines a method isSubtree to determine whether one binary tree is a subtree of another. The solution employs a recursive approach facilitated by two functions: isSubtree and check. Here’s how each part of the code contributes to solving the problem:  

Function isSubtree(TreeNode root, TreeNode subRoot):  

Base Case: If root is null, it immediately returns false because a non-existent tree cannot contain a subtree.  

Subtree Check: Uses the helper function check to determine if the tree rooted at the current node (root) matches the subtree rooted at subRoot.  

Recursive Descent: If the current nodes do not match, the function recurses into the left and right children of root, checking if subRoot is a subtree of any node in these subtrees. It returns true if either recursive call finds a match.  

Helper Function check(TreeNode root, TreeNode subRoot):  

Base Cases:  
If both root and subRoot are null, returns true because two empty trees are trivially identical.  
If only one of the nodes is null, returns false because a tree cannot be identical to a non-existent tree.  
If the values of root and subRoot do not match, returns false because the trees cannot be identical if their root values differ.  

Recursive Checks: If the current nodes match, the function recursively checks if the left children of both trees match and if the right children match. Both sides must return true for the trees to be considered identical.  

Overall Strategy:  
The isSubtree function explores each node of the main tree (root) and uses the check function to see if the subtree rooted at the current node matches the subRoot.  
The check function is a thorough comparison tool that recursively confirms if two trees are identical from the root down to the leaves.  
This implementation effectively traverses the primary tree, checking at each node whether the subtree starting from that node matches the structure and values of subRoot. This method ensures all possible roots for the subtree are considered, allowing for a comprehensive search of potential subtree matches.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubtree(TreeNode root, TreeNode subRoot) {

        if(root == null) return false;
        if(check(root, subRoot)) return true;

        return isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) || isSubtree(root.right, subRoot);
        
    }

    public boolean check(TreeNode root, TreeNode subRoot){
        if(root == null && subRoot == null) return true;
        else if(root == null && subRoot != null) return false;
        else if(root != null && subRoot == null) return false;
        else if(root.val != subRoot.val) return false;

        return check(root.left, subRoot.left) && check(root.right, subRoot.right);
    }
}
```
