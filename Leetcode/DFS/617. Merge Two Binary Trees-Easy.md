## Question:

You are given two binary trees root1 and root2.  

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.  

Return the merged tree.  

Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.  

Example 1:  

Input: root1 = [1,3,2,5], root2 = [2,1,3,null,4,null,7]  
Output: [3,4,5,5,4,null,7]  

Example 2:  

Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1,2]  
Output: [2,2]  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 2000].  
-104 <= Node.val <= 104

## Thought:
We use DFS to do it.  

This Java code defines a method to merge two binary trees by summing the values of their nodes. The function recursively combines the trees into one by updating the first tree (root1) in place. Hereâ€™s the design and logic explained:  

Base Cases:  
If both root1 and root2 are null, the function returns null, indicating that there is no node to merge at this position.  
If root1 is not null but root2 is null, the function returns root1. This means that the first tree already contains the necessary structure at this point, and no additional merging is required.  
Similarly, if root2 is not null but root1 is null, the function returns root2. This indicates that the node from the second tree should be used as there is no corresponding node in the first tree at this position.  

Merging Nodes:  
If both root1 and root2 are not null, their values are summed and stored in root1. This modifies root1 to hold the merged value of both trees at that node.  

Recursive Merging:  
The function recursively merges the left children of root1 and root2, and sets root1.left to the result of this merge. This ensures that the entire left subtree of the merged tree is built correctly.  
It does the same for the right children, setting root1.right to the result of recursively merging the right subtrees.  
 
Return Merged Tree:  
The function returns root1, which now represents the root of the newly merged tree. This tree contains the sum of corresponding nodes from both input trees, and it incorporates all nodes from both trees where only one tree had a node at a particular position.  
This method is effective for merging two trees into a single tree where each node's value is the sum of the values of corresponding nodes in the input trees. It handles nodes from both trees efficiently, ensuring that the structure of both input trees is preserved in the merged result wherever possible.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        if(root1 == null && root2 == null) return null;

        else if(root1 != null && root2 == null) return root1;

        else if(root2 != null && root1 == null) return root2;

        root1.val = root1.val + root2.val;

        root1.left = mergeTrees(root1.left, root2.left);
        root1.right = mergeTrees(root1.right, root2.right);

        return root1;
    }

}
```
