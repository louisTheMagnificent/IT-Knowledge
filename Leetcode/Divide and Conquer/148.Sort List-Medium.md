## Question:

Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.   

Example 1:  


Input: head = [4,2,1,3]  
Output: [1,2,3,4]  

Example 2:  

Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]  
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]  

Example 3:  

Input: head = []  
Output: []  

Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 104].  
-105 <= Node.val <= 105  

Follow up: Can you sort the linked list in O(n logn) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space)?

## Thougth:
We use merge sort to do it. 
1. Divide: Use two pointers (slow and fast) to find the midpoint of the linked list. The slow pointer advances one node at a time, while the fast pointer moves two nodes at a time. When fast reaches the end, slow is at the midpoint. Split the list into two halves at this point.  
2. Conquer: Recursively apply merge sort to both halves. Continue splitting each half until you reach lists of one node or no nodes, which are inherently sorted.  
3. Merge: Combine two sorted halves into a single sorted list by comparing the nodes from each half and appending the smaller node to the resulting list. Continue until all nodes are merged.  
4. Result: The head of the newly merged list is returned up the call stack, resulting in a fully sorted linked list.  
This approach sorts a linked list efficiently without requiring additional space for array indices, making it particularly suitable for linked data structures.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode sortList(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;

        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode prev = null;

        while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        prev.next = null;

        ListNode node1 = sortList(head);
        ListNode node2 = sortList(slow);

        return merge(node1, node2);
    }

    public ListNode merge(ListNode node1, ListNode node2){
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode();
        ListNode curr = dummy;

        while(node1 != null && node2 != null){
            if(node1.val < node2.val){
                curr.next = node1;
                curr = curr.next;
                node1 = node1.next;
            }
            else{
                curr.next = node2;
                curr = curr.next;
                node2 = node2.next;
            }
        }

        if(node1 == null){
            curr.next = node2;
        }
        else if(node2 == null){
            curr.next = node1;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
