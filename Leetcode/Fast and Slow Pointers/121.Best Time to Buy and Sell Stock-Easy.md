## Question: 

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]  
Output: 5  

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.  
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]  
Output: 0  

Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.  
 
Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105  
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

## Thought 1:
We set two pointers to fulfill it. One is slow and the other is fast. If array.length == 1, we return 0 directly. The slow points at 
the first element and the fast points at the second one. We set result as 0. If the fast value is larger than the slow one, we calculate the 
discrepancy. If it is larger than the result, we renew the result. If the fast value is not larger than the slow, we renew the slow pointer to the 
fast one position. After that, we move fast to the next. Conduct the loop until the fast one finishes the traversal. Then we return the result.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices.length == 1) return 0;
        int fast = 1, slow = 0;
        int result = 0;
        while(fast < prices.length){
            if(prices[fast] <= prices[slow]) slow = fast;
            else if(prices[fast] - prices[slow] > result) result = prices[fast] - prices[slow];
            fast++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Thought 2: 
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code solves the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" problem using a dynamic programming approach, where the objective is to maximize the profit from a single transaction given a list of daily stock prices:  

Initialization of DP Array:  
A 2D array dp is created where dp[i][0] represents the maximum loss (or the minimum value after buying the stock) up to day i, and dp[i][1] represents the maximum profit achievable up to day i after selling the stock.  
dp[0][0] is initialized to -prices[0], indicating that the stock is bought on the first day, and dp[0][1] is initialized to 0, indicating no profit on the first day as no sale has occurred.  

Filling the DP Table:  
Iterate through the list of stock prices starting from the second day (i=1 to prices.length-1).  

For each day i:  
dp[i][0] is updated to the maximum of dp[i - 1][0] (not buying on day i) and -prices[i] (buying on day i).  
dp[i][1] is updated to the maximum of dp[i - 1][1] (not selling on day i) and prices[i] + dp[i - 1][0] (selling on day i, which is the price on day i plus the best result from holding a stock bought on previous days).  

Returning the Result:  
The function returns dp[prices.length - 1][1], which contains the maximum profit possible up to the last day, reflecting the best outcome after potentially selling the stock.  

This approach ensures that each day's decision to buy or sell is made considering the optimal outcomes from previous days, allowing the calculation of the maximum possible profit from a single buy and sell transaction across the given price range.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][2];
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0];
        dp[0][1] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], -prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], prices[i] + dp[i - 1][0]);
        }

        return dp[prices.length - 1][1];
    }
}
```

## Thought 3:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code implements a space-optimized dynamic programming approach to solve the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" problem, aiming to find the maximum profit from a single transaction given a list of daily stock prices:  

Initialization:  
A 1D array dp with two elements is used where dp[0] keeps track of the maximum loss or the least negative balance after buying stock (i.e., the minimum price paid for the stock so far), and dp[1] tracks the maximum profit obtainable after selling the stock.  

Updating the DP Array:  
The array is initially set with dp[0] = -prices[0] to represent buying the stock on the first day and dp[1] = 0 indicating no profit before any sale.  
For each day starting from the second day (index 1 to prices.length - 1):  
Update dp[1] to reflect the maximum profit by comparing the current value of dp[1] with the profit from selling the stock on that day (current price + maximum loss/buy balance recorded in dp[0]).  
Update dp[0] to reflect the maximum loss/buy balance by comparing the current value of dp[0] with the negative of the stock price on that day (simulating buying the stock at that price).  

Returning the Result:  
The function returns dp[1] which holds the maximum profit achievable with one transaction over the entire period.  

This approach utilizes constant space and efficiently computes the desired maximum profit with minimal computational overhead by dynamically adjusting the buy and sell decisions based on the changing stock prices.

## Solution 3:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int[] dp = new int[2];
        dp[0] = -prices[0];
        dp[1] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            dp[1] = Math.max(dp[1], prices[i] + dp[0]);
            dp[0] = Math.max(dp[0], -prices[i]);
        }

        return dp[1];
    }
}
```
