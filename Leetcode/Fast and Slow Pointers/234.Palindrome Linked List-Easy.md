## Question:

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.   

Example 1:  

Input: head = [1,2,2,1]  
Output: true  

Example 2:  

Input: head = [1,2]  
Output: false  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].  
0 <= Node.val <= 9  
 
Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

## Thought:
We use fast and slow pointers to do it.

The Java code defines a solution to check if a singly-linked list is a palindrome. It uses a two-pointer technique for efficiency:  

Identify the Middle of the List:  
Utilize two pointers, fast and slow. Move fast at twice the speed of slow. When fast reaches the end of the list, slow will be at the midpoint.  

Reverse the Second Half:  
Starting from slow, reverse the second half of the list. prev acts as the new head of the reversed half by the end of the loop.  

Compare the Two Halves:  
Reset slow to the head of the list and use prev (now the head of the reversed half) to compare values. If any values differ, the list is not a palindrome.   

Return Result:  
If all corresponding nodes in the two halves match, return true, indicating the list is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.  

This method effectively checks for palindrome properties without requiring additional space proportional to the list size, running in O(n) time complexity where n is the number of nodes in the list.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        if(head.next == null) return true;
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;

        while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = slow;

        while(curr != null){
            ListNode next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;            
        }

        slow = head;
        while(slow != null && prev != null){
            if(slow.val != prev.val) return false;
            slow = slow.next;
            prev = prev.next;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
