## Question:

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.  

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]  
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [0]  
Output: [0]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 104  
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1  
 
Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

## Thought:
We use fast and slow pointers to do it. This Java code defines a method, moveZeroes, that takes an array of integers and moves all the zeroes to the end of the array while maintaining the order of the non-zero elements. The method uses a two-pointer approach with slow and fast pointers. The slow pointer is used to find the position where a zero is located, and the fast pointer is used to find a non-zero number to swap with the zero at the slow pointer's position. This process continues until the fast pointer has checked all elements in the array. If fast reaches the end of the array and all remaining elements are zeroes, the loop ends, leaving all the zeroes moved to the end of the array.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int slow = 0; 
        int fast = 0;
        while(fast < nums.length){
            if(nums[slow] != 0){
                slow++;
                fast++;
            }
            else{
                while(fast < nums.length && nums[fast] == 0){
                    fast++;
                }
                if(fast == nums.length) break;
                int change = nums[fast];
                nums[fast] = nums[slow];
                nums[slow] = change;
            }
        }
        return;
    }
}
```
