## Question:

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:  

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.  
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.  
sk == endWord  
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.  

Example 1:  

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]  
Output: 5  

Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.  

Example 2:  

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]  
Output: 0  

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= beginWord.length <= 10  
endWord.length == beginWord.length  
1 <= wordList.length <= 5000  
wordList[i].length == beginWord.length  
beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.  
beginWord != endWord  
All the words in wordList are unique.

## Thought:
We use bfs to do it.

The provided Java code implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to solve the "Word Ladder" problem. The objective is to determine the shortest transformation sequence from a start word (beginWord) to a target word (endWord) by changing one letter at a time, where each intermediate word must exist in a given list of words (wordList). Here's a brief overview of the design and logic of the code:  

Core Concepts  
Layered BFS Using a Queue:  
A queue is employed to facilitate BFS through the word space. Each element in the queue represents a potential step in the transformation sequence, and BFS explores these transformations level by level.  

Set for Efficient Lookup:  
A HashSet called set contains all the words from wordList and is used to check if a transformed word is valid in constant time. Another HashSet called visited keeps track of words that have already been processed to prevent processing the same word multiple times.  

Distance Measurement:  
An integer length is utilized to track the number of transformation steps required to reach the current word in the BFS process.  

Character Transformation:  
For each word, the algorithm iterates through each character position, trying all possible substitutions from 'a' to 'z'. This forms the potential next steps in the transformation sequence.  

Detailed Steps  

Initialization: The algorithm starts by checking if the endWord exists in the wordList. If not, it returns 0 indicating no possible transformation.  

Queue Setup: The beginWord is added to the queue, indicating the start of the BFS.  

BFS Execution: While the queue is not empty:  
The word at the front of the queue is dequeued and considered the current word.  
For the current word, each character is replaced in turn by every letter from 'a' to 'z', forming a new word.  
If the new word is in set and hasn't been visited yet, it's added to the queue and marked as visited.  
If the new word is the endWord, the current length of the transformation sequence is returned.  

End of Queue: If the queue is exhausted without finding the endWord, 0 is returned, indicating no possible sequence exists.  

Efficiency Considerations  
The use of HashSet for set and visited ensures that the membership checks are efficient.  
The use of null as a marker in the queue helps manage the increment of length for each level of words processed, though alternative methods like counting elements per level can enhance clarity.  

This BFS approach ensures that the shortest path (if one exists) from the beginWord to the endWord is found in the most efficient manner given the constraints of the problem.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        if(!wordList.contains(endWord)) return 0;
        int length = 1;
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>(wordList);
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        set.add(beginWord);

        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(beginWord);
        queue.add(null);
        visited.add(beginWord);

        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            String node = queue.poll();
            if (node == null) {
                if (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                    length++;
                    queue.add(null);
                }
                continue;
            }
            
            char[] charArray = node.toCharArray();
            
            for (int i = 0; i < charArray.length; i++) {
                char old = charArray[i];
                for (char j = 'a'; j <= 'z'; j++) {
                    charArray[i] = j;
                    String newWord = new String(charArray);
                    if (set.contains(newWord) && !visited.contains(newWord)) {
                        queue.add(newWord);
                        visited.add(newWord);
                        if (newWord.equals(endWord)) return length + 1;
                    }
                }
                charArray[i] = old;
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```
