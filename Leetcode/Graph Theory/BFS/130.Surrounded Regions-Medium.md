## Question:

You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture regions that are surrounded:  

Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.  
Region: To form a region connect every 'O' cell.  
Surround: The region is surrounded with 'X' cells if you can connect the region with 'X' cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the board.  
To capture a surrounded region, replace all 'O's with 'X's in-place within the original board. You do not need to return anything.  

Example 1:  

Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]  

Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]  

Explanation:  

In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.  

Example 2:  

Input: board = [["X"]]  

Output: [["X"]]  

Constraints:  

m == board.length  
n == board[i].length  
1 <= m, n <= 200  
board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.

## Thought:
We use bfs to do it.

This Java solution addresses the "Surrounded Regions" problem on a 2D board. It utilizes a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to identify 'O' cells that are connected to the boundary of the board, marking them as non-flippable. The primary steps and logic are as follows:  

Initialization  
The board's dimensions are defined by n (rows) and m (columns).  
A BFS is initiated from every 'O' located on the board's boundary (both the top and bottom rows, and left and right columns).  

BFS Process  
For each 'O' found on the boundary, a BFS is performed to traverse and mark all connected 'O's to 'o', indicating they should not be flipped.  
The BFS uses a queue to manage the cells that need to be processed, checking all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) from each cell.  

Final Adjustment  
After marking the boundary-connected 'O's, the entire board is scanned:  
Any 'O' that wasn't marked as 'o' (thus not connected to the boundary) is flipped to 'X' as it is surrounded.  
Cells marked as 'o' during the BFS are reverted back to 'O'.  

Conclusion  
This method ensures that only the truly surrounded regions (not connected to any boundary) are flipped, preserving the integrity of regions connected to the board's edges. The implementation effectively prevents any 'O' from being incorrectly flipped if it has a path to the boundary, leveraging the BFS for comprehensive area marking.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        int n = board.length;
        int m = board[0].length;
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][n];

        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            if(board[0][i] == 'O'){
                bfs(board, 0, i);
            }

            if(board[n - 1][i] == 'O'){
                bfs(board, n - 1, i);
            }
        }

        for(int j = 1; j < n - 1; j++){
            if(board[j][0] == 'O'){
                bfs(board, j, 0);
            }

            if(board[j][m - 1] == 'O'){
                bfs(board, j, m - 1);
            }
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < m; j++){
                if(board[i][j] == 'O'){
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                }
                else if(board[i][j] == 'o'){
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
                }
            }
        }

        return;
    }

    public void bfs(char[][] board, int y, int x){
        Queue<Pair> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.add(new Pair(y, x));
        board[y][x] = 'o';
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            Pair curr = queue.poll();
            if(curr.y - 1 >= 0 && board[curr.y - 1][curr.x] == 'O'){
                board[curr.y - 1][curr.x] = 'o';
                queue.add(new Pair(curr.y - 1, curr.x));
            }
            if(curr.y + 1 < board.length && board[curr.y + 1][curr.x] == 'O'){
                board[curr.y + 1][curr.x] = 'o';
                queue.add(new Pair(curr.y + 1, curr.x));
            }
            if(curr.x - 1 >= 0 && board[curr.y][curr.x - 1] == 'O'){
                board[curr.y][curr.x - 1] = 'o';
                queue.add(new Pair(curr.y, curr.x - 1));
            }
            if(curr.x + 1 < board[0].length && board[curr.y][curr.x + 1] == 'O'){
                board[curr.y][curr.x + 1] = 'o';
                queue.add(new Pair(curr.y, curr.x + 1));
            }
        }
    }
}

class Pair{
    int y;
    int x;

    public Pair(int y, int x){
        this.y = y;
        this.x = x;
    }
}
