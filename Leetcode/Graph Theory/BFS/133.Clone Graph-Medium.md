## Question:

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.  

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.  

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.  

class Node {  
    public int val;  
    public List<Node> neighbors;  
}  
 
Test case format:  

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.  

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.  

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.  

Example 1:  

Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]  
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]  
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.  
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).  
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).  
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).  
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).  

Example 2:  

Input: adjList = [[]]  
Output: [[]]  

Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.  

Example 3:  

Input: adjList = []  
Output: []  

Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].  
1 <= Node.val <= 100  
Node.val is unique for each node.  
There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.  
The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

## Thought:
We use bfs to do it.

This Java code clones a graph using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. Here's the simplified overview:  

Key Steps  

Initial Validation: Checks if the input node is null or isolated and handles these cases accordingly.  

Mapping and Queue Setup:  
Uses a HashMap to track original nodes and their clones.  
Starts BFS with the input node using a Queue.  

BFS Process:  
Iterates through each node, clones unvisited neighbors, and maps original to cloned nodes.  
Establishes neighbor relationships for cloned nodes based on the original graph's connections.  

Result:  
Returns the cloned version of the input node, providing access to the entire cloned graph.  

Purpose  
This method ensures a one-time cloning of each node and accurately replicates all connections, using BFS for systematic graph traversal.

## Solution:
```Java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    public Node(int _val, ArrayList<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if(node == null) return null;
        if(node.neighbors.size() == 0) return new Node(node.val);
        
        Map<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        map.put(node, new Node(node.val));

        queue.add(node);

        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            Node curr = queue.poll();
            for(Node neighbor : curr.neighbors){
                if(!map.containsKey(neighbor)){
                    map.put(neighbor, new Node(neighbor.val));
                    queue.add(neighbor);
                }
                map.get(curr).neighbors.add(map.get(neighbor));
            }
        }

        return map.get(node);
    }
}
```
