## Question:

A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.  

Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string startGene to a gene string endGene where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.  

For example, "AACCGGTT" --> "AACCGGTA" is one mutation.  
There is also a gene bank bank that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in bank to make it a valid gene string.  

Given the two gene strings startGene and endGene and the gene bank bank, return the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from startGene to endGene. If there is no such a mutation, return -1.  

Note that the starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.  

Example 1:  

Input: startGene = "AACCGGTT", endGene = "AACCGGTA", bank = ["AACCGGTA"]  
Output: 1  

Example 2:  

Input: startGene = "AACCGGTT", endGene = "AAACGGTA", bank = ["AACCGGTA","AACCGCTA","AAACGGTA"]  
Output: 2   

Constraints:  

0 <= bank.length <= 10  
startGene.length == endGene.length == bank[i].length == 8  
startGene, endGene, and bank[i] consist of only the characters ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'].

## Thought:
We use bfs to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to the genetic mutation problem, where the goal is to find the minimum number of mutations required to transform a start gene sequence into a target gene sequence. The mutations must change only one character at a time and each intermediate gene sequence must exist within a provided list of valid gene sequences (the bank). The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of its design and logic in English:  

Design and Logic  

Initialization:  
A HashSet named set is used to store the start gene and all genes from the bank to quickly check for the existence of any gene sequence during the mutation process.  
Another HashSet named visited is used to keep track of the gene sequences that have already been processed, to avoid reprocessing and looping.  

BFS Setup:  
A Queue is initialized and the start gene is added as the starting point for the BFS.  
result, an integer variable, is initialized to track the number of mutation steps required to reach the target gene.  

BFS Execution:  
The BFS continues until the queue is empty, processing each level (or mutation step) one at a time.  
For each gene sequence pulled from the queue, it generates all possible mutations by changing each character to the other three possible nucleotides (A, C, G, T).  
If a generated mutation matches the target gene, the function returns the current count of mutation steps incremented by one.  
If the mutation is valid (exists in the set) and has not been visited, it is added to the queue and marked as visited.  

Termination:  
If the BFS completes without finding the target gene, the function returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to achieve the target gene from the start gene given the constraints.  

Key Functionalities  
Efficient Mutation Generation: For each gene in the queue, the code tries all possible single-character mutations, ensuring that each possibility is considered.  
Quick Membership Testing: Both the set and visited use HashSet for O(1) average-time complexity on membership testing, which is crucial for maintaining performance.  
Early Exit: The code checks if the endGene is in the set right at the beginning and exits early if it's not, optimizing scenarios where the target is unachievable.  
BFS for Minimal Steps: Using BFS ensures that the shortest path (minimum mutations) to the target gene is found, as BFS explores all options of a particular "distance" before moving to deeper levels.  

This approach is robust and efficient for solving problems involving sequences or paths where transformations are constrained to predefined valid changes, such as genetic sequences or characters in a string.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int minMutation(String startGene, String endGene, String[] bank) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add(startGene);
        for(int i = 0; i < bank.length; i++){
            set.add(bank[i]);
        }
        if(!set.contains(endGene)) return -1;
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();

        char[] dict = {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'};

        Queue<String> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.add(startGene);
        int result = 0;
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            int size = queue.size();
            while(size-- > 0){
                String curr = queue.poll();
                char[] charArray = curr.toCharArray();
                for(int i = 0; i < curr.length(); i++){
                    char old = charArray[i];
                    for(int j = 0; j < 4; j++){
                        charArray[i] = dict[j];
                        String converted = new String(charArray);
                        if(converted.equals(endGene)) return result + 1;
                        else if(!visited.contains(converted) && set.contains(converted)){
                            queue.add(converted);
                            visited.add(converted);
                        }
                    }
                    charArray[i] = old;
                }
            }
            result++;
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```
