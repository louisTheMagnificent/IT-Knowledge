## Question:

You are given an n x n integer matrix board where the cells are labeled from 1 to n2 in a Boustrophedon style starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. board[n - 1][0]) and alternating direction each row.  

You start on square 1 of the board. In each move, starting from square curr, do the following:  

Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].  
This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.  
If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.  
The game ends when you reach the square n2.  
A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c] != -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c]. Squares 1 and n2 are not the starting points of any snake or ladder.  

Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per dice roll. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.  

For example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move, your destination square is 2. You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to 4.  
Return the least number of dice rolls required to reach the square n2. If it is not possible to reach the square, return -1.  

Example 1:  

Input: board = [[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]  
Output: 4  

Explanation:   
In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).  
You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.  
You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.  
You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.  
You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.  
This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.  

Example 2:  

Input: board = [[-1,-1],[-1,3]]  
Output: 1  
 
Constraints:  

n == board.length == board[i].length  
2 <= n <= 20  
board[i][j] is either -1 or in the range [1, n2].  
The squares labeled 1 and n2 are not the starting points of any snake or ladder.

## Thought:
We use bfs to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to the "Snakes and Ladders" game using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's a brief summary of the design and logic:  

Core Components  

Data Structures:  
queue: A Queue to store each board position that can be reached. It helps explore the board level by level.  
visited: A 2D boolean array to keep track of visited positions to prevent processing the same position multiple times.  

Algorithm Overview  

Initialization:  
Start by adding the initial position (1) to the queue and mark it as visited.  
The game board is traversed using BFS to ensure the shortest path is found due to its level-wise exploration.  

BFS Loop:  
The algorithm processes nodes level by level until the queue is empty or the last position (n*n) is reached.  

For each current position, it simulates dice rolls (from 1 to 6):  
Calculate the new position after the dice roll.  
Convert this position to the corresponding row and column on the board using the findNext function.  
Check if the new position has been visited:  
If not, mark it as visited.  
If the new position on the board is a snake or ladder (indicated by a non-negative number), jump directly to that position; otherwise, move to the position reached by the dice roll.  

Utility Function - findNext:  
Converts a board position number to its respective row and column, considering the boardâ€™s serpentine layout where even rows are left to right and odd rows are right to left.  

Key Functionalities  
Efficiently find the shortest path from start to end using BFS, appropriately handling jumps due to snakes or ladders.  
Ensure each position is processed once to optimize performance and prevent infinite loops.  

This approach leverages BFS to systematically explore all possible game moves, ensuring that the shortest path to the end of the game is found, if it exists.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {
    public int snakesAndLadders(int[][] board) {
        int n = board.length;
        int move = 0;
        Queue<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][n];
        queue.add(1);
        visited[n - 1][0] = true;
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            int size = queue.size();
            for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
                int curr = queue.poll();
                if(curr == n * n) return move;
                for(int j = 1; j <= 6; j++){
                    if(curr + j > n * n) break;
                    int[] pos = findNext(curr + j, n);
                    int row = pos[0];
                    int col = pos[1];
                    if(!visited[row][col]){
                        visited[row][col] = true;
                        if(board[row][col] == -1){
                            queue.add(curr + j);
                        }
                        else{
                            queue.add(board[row][col]);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            move++;
        }

        return -1;
    }

    public int[] findNext(int curr, int n){
        int row = n - (curr - 1) / n - 1;
        int col = (curr - 1) % n;
        if(row % 2 == n % 2){
            return new int[]{row, n - 1 - col};
        }
        else {
            return new int[]{row, col};
        }
    }
}
