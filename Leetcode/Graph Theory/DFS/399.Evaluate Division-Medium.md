## Question:

You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.  

You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.  

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.  

Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.  

Note: The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.  

Example 1:  

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]  
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]  

Explanation:   
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0  
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?   
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]  
note: x is undefined => -1.0  

Example 2:  

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]  
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]  

Example 3:  

Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]  
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]  
  
Constraints:  

1 <= equations.length <= 20  
equations[i].length == 2  
1 <= Ai.length, Bi.length <= 5  
values.length == equations.length  
0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0  
1 <= queries.length <= 20  
queries[i].length == 2  
1 <= Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5  
Ai, Bi, Cj, Dj consist of lower case English letters and digits.

## Thought:
We use dfs to do it.

This Java code solves the problem of evaluating division among variables given in the form of equations. Here is a brief overview of how it accomplishes this:  

Graph Construction  
The buildGraph method creates a directed graph using a HashMap where each node (variable) maps to another HashMap. This nested map holds adjacent nodes and the weight of the edge between them, representing the division result of the two variables.  
For each equation like a / b = k, it adds both a -> b with a weight of k and b -> a with a weight of 1/k to handle division in both directions.  

Depth-First Search (DFS)  
The dfs method recursively searches for a path from the starting variable (node) to the target variable (destination) in the graph. It maintains a set of visited nodes to avoid cycles and accumulates the product of edge weights along the path.  
If the destination node is reached during the traversal, the accumulated product is stored as the result.  

Calculation of Queries  
The calcEquation method processes each query to determine the division result between two variables using the graph.  
If either of the queried variables does not exist in the graph, the result is set to -1.0.  
Otherwise, it performs a DFS from the dividend to the divisor. If a valid path is found, it returns the computed product; if not, it returns -1.0.  

Return  
Returns an array of results for each query, based on the presence of a valid path in the graph and the computation of the division through DFS.  

This solution effectively uses graph theory and DFS to handle potentially complex chains of divisions and multiplications, represented as graph traversals.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    public void dfs(String node, String dest, HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Double>> graph, HashSet<String> visited, double[] answer, double temp) {
        if (visited.contains(node))
            return;

        visited.add(node);
        if (node.equals(dest)) {
            answer[0] = temp;
            return;
        }

        for (Map.Entry<String, Double> entry : graph.get(node).entrySet()) {
            String next = entry.getKey();
            double val = entry.getValue();
            dfs(next, dest, graph, visited, answer, temp * val);
        }
    }

    public HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Double>> buildGraph(List<List<String>> equations, double[] values) {
        HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Double>> graph = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < equations.size(); i++) {
            String dividend = equations.get(i).get(0);
            String divisor = equations.get(i).get(1);
            double value = values[i];

            graph.putIfAbsent(dividend, new HashMap<>());
            graph.putIfAbsent(divisor, new HashMap<>());

            graph.get(dividend).put(divisor, value);
            graph.get(divisor).put(dividend, 1.0 / value);
        }

        return graph;
    }

    public double[] calcEquation(List<List<String>> equations, double[] values, List<List<String>> queries) {
        HashMap<String, HashMap<String, Double>> graph = buildGraph(equations, values);
        double[] finalAnswer = new double[queries.size()];

        for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
            String dividend = queries.get(i).get(0);
            String divisor = queries.get(i).get(1);

            if (!graph.containsKey(dividend) || !graph.containsKey(divisor)) {
                finalAnswer[i] = -1.0;
            } 
            else {
                HashSet<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
                double[] answer = {-1.0};
                double temp = 1.0;
                dfs(dividend, divisor, graph, visited, answer, temp);
                finalAnswer[i] = answer[0];
            }
        }

        return finalAnswer;
    }
}
