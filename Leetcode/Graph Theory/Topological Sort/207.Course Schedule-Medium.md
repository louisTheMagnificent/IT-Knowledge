## Question:

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.  

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.  
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.  

Example 1:  

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]  
Output: true  

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.   
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.  

Example 2:  

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]  
Output: false  

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.   
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= numCourses <= 2000  
0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000  
prerequisites[i].length == 2  
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses  
All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

## Thought:
We use topological sort to do it.  

This Java code implements the canFinish method in the Solution class, which determines if it is possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites. The method uses a graph topological sorting technique based on Kahn's Algorithm.  

The code first sets up an adjacency list adjList to represent the graph of courses and their prerequisites. Each course is represented as a node, and prerequisites are directed edges between nodes. It also initializes an inDegree array to track the number of incoming edges (prerequisites) for each course.  

The core of the algorithm involves populating the adjacency list and the inDegree array based on the given prerequisites. For every course that can be taken immediately (with zero prerequisites, indicated by an inDegree of zero), it's added to a queue.  

The main loop processes courses from the queue, representing a course that can be taken without prerequisites at that moment. For each such course, it reduces the inDegree of the courses that depend on it. Whenever the inDegree of a course drops to zero, it's added to the queue, indicating that it can now be taken.  

The algorithm keeps count of the courses processed. If all courses have been processed (i.e., the count equals the number of courses), it returns true, indicating that it is indeed possible to complete all courses. Otherwise, if there are courses left that couldn't be taken due to remaining prerequisites, it returns false.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        
        List<List<Integer>> adjList = new ArrayList<>();

        int[] inDegree = new int[numCourses];

        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            adjList.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        for(int[] edge : prerequisites){
            adjList.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
            inDegree[edge[0]]++;
        }

        Queue<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            if(inDegree[i] == 0) queue.offer(i);
        }

        int available = 0;
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            int curr = queue.poll();
            List<Integer> currList = adjList.get(curr);
            for(int node : currList){
                inDegree[node]--;
                if(inDegree[node] == 0){
                    queue.offer(node);
                }
            }
            available++;
        }

        return available == numCourses;
    }
}
```
