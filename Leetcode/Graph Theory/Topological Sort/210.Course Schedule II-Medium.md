## Question:

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.  

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.  
Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.  

Example 1:  

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]  
Output: [0,1]  

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].  

Example 2:  

Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]  
Output: [0,2,1,3]  

Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.  
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].  

Example 3:  

Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []  
Output: [0]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= numCourses <= 2000  
0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)  
prerequisites[i].length == 2  
0 <= ai, bi < numCourses  
ai != bi  
All the pairs [ai, bi] are distinct.

## Thought: 
We use topological sort to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to the "Course Schedule II" problem on LeetCode using Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. The main goal is to find an order in which all the courses can be finished considering their prerequisites. Here's a brief breakdown of the approach:  

Initialization:  
adjList stores the adjacency list for the graph where each course points to its subsequent courses (dependent courses).  
inDegree array keeps track of the number of prerequisites (incoming edges) for each course.  

Graph Construction:  
For each prerequisite pair, the adjacency list is updated, and the indegree of the dependent course is incremented.  

Order Array and Queue:  
result array will store the courses in the order they can be completed.  
A Queue is used to manage courses with zero prerequisites (indegree of zero), indicating they are ready to be taken.  

Topological Sorting:  
Courses are dequeued and added to the result array.  
For each course removed from the queue, the indegree of its dependent courses is decremented. If a courseâ€™s indegree drops to zero, it is added to the queue.  

Result Evaluation:  
If the number of courses in the result array matches numCourses, it indicates that all courses can be completed, and the result array is returned.  
If not, an empty array is returned, indicating that it's not possible to complete all courses due to cycles in the graph.  

This solution efficiently constructs the course schedule using a topological sort, ensuring that all prerequisites are considered, and courses are added to the schedule only when they are ready to be taken.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    public int[] findOrder(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {

        if(numCourses == 0) return new int[0];
        
        List<List<Integer>> adjList = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] inDegree = new int[numCourses];

        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            adjList.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < prerequisites.length; i++){
            adjList.get(prerequisites[i][1]).add(prerequisites[i][0]);
            inDegree[prerequisites[i][0]]++;
        }

        int[] result = new int[numCourses];
        Queue<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();

        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            if(inDegree[i] == 0) queue.offer(i);
        }

        int currIndex = 0;

        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            int curr = queue.poll();
            List<Integer> currList = adjList.get(curr);
            for(int i = 0; i < currList.size(); i++){
                inDegree[currList.get(i)]--;
                if(inDegree[currList.get(i)] == 0) queue.offer(currList.get(i));
            }
            result[currIndex] = curr;
            currIndex++;
        }

        return currIndex == numCourses ? result : new int[0];
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(numCourses + prerequisites.length)  
Space complexity: O(numCourses + prerequisites.length)
