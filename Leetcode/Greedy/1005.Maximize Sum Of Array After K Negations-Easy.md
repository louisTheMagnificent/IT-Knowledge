## Question:

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, modify the array in the following way:  

choose an index i and replace nums[i] with -nums[i].  
You should apply this process exactly k times. You may choose the same index i multiple times.  

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [4,2,3], k = 1  
Output: 5  

Explanation: Choose index 1 and nums becomes [4,-2,3].  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [3,-1,0,2], k = 3  
Output: 6  

Explanation: Choose indices (1, 2, 2) and nums becomes [3,1,0,2].  

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [2,-3,-1,5,-4], k = 2  
Output: 13  

Explanation: Choose indices (1, 4) and nums becomes [2,3,-1,5,4].  

Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 104  
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100

## Thought:
We use greedy to do it.

This Java code is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of an array after making exactly k negations. The solution follows these steps:  

Sort the Array: Begin by sorting the array nums. This allows the algorithm to first consider the smallest elements, which are likely negative, for negation.  
Negate Negative Numbers: Iterate through the sorted array and negate the negative numbers until either all negative numbers are exhausted or k negations have been used up.  

Handle Remaining Negations:  
If k negations are still remaining after processing all negative numbers, check the positioning:  
If at the end of the array (i == nums.length), adjust i to point to the last element.  
Otherwise, decide whether to move back one position to negate a smaller positive number if it is advantageous.  
If k is odd after all adjustments, negate the current number at index i to utilize the remaining negation.  
Calculate Final Sum: Sum up all elements of the modified array to get the final result.  

This method ensures that the negations are applied in the most beneficial way possible by focusing on the smallest elements first, thereby maximizing the array's sum. The complexity is primarily dependent on the sorting step, making the overall time complexity O(n log n).

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int largestSumAfterKNegations(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int i = 0;
        while(i < nums.length && nums[i] < 0){
            nums[i] = -nums[i];
            i++;
            k--;
            if(k == 0) break;
        }

        if(k != 0){
            if(i == nums.length){
                i = i - 1;
            }
            else if(i - 1 >= 0 && nums[i] > nums[i - 1]){
                i = i - 1;
            }
            if(k % 2 == 1){
                nums[i] = -nums[i];
            }
        }
        int sum = 0;

        for(int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++){
            sum += nums[j];
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(nlogn)  
Space complexity: O(1)
1 <= k <= 104
