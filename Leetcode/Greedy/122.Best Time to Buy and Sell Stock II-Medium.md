## Question:

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]  
Output: 7  

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.  
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.  
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.  

Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]  
Output: 4  

Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.  
Total profit is 4.  

Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]  
Output: 0  

Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

Constraints:  

1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104  
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

## Thought 1: 
We use two pointers and greedy to fulfil it. One pointer is slow and the other is fast. If array.length == 1, we return 0 directly. The slow points at the first element and the fast points at the second one. We set result as 0. If the fast value is larger than the slow one, we calculate the discrepancy and add it to the result. Then no matter the result is renewed or not, we always renew the slow pointer to the fast one position. After that, we move fast to the next. Conduct the loop until the fast one finishes the traversal. Then we return the result.

## Solution 1: 
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices.length == 1) return 0;
        int slow = 0, fast = 1;
        int result = 0;
        while(fast < prices.length){
            if(prices[fast] > prices[slow]) result += prices[fast] - prices[slow];
            slow = fast;
            fast++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Thought 2: 
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown" problem using a dynamic programming approach, where the objective is to maximize the profit from transactions given a list of daily stock prices, and after selling a stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (cooldown period):  

Initialization of DP Array:  
A 2D array dp is used where:  
dp[i][0] represents the maximum profit on day i when holding a stock.  
dp[i][1] represents the maximum profit on day i when not holding a stock.  
The array is initialized with dp[0][0] = -prices[0], representing buying the stock on the first day, and dp[0][1] = 0, indicating no profit on the first day without any stock.  

Filling the DP Table:  
For each day starting from the second day (i = 1 to prices.length - 1):  
dp[i][0] is updated to the maximum of holding the stock from the previous day or buying the stock today (which requires not having a stock the day before, thus dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]).  
dp[i][1] is updated to the maximum of not holding any stock from the previous day or selling the stock today (thus dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i]).  

Returning the Result:  
The function returns dp[prices.length - 1][1], which contains the maximum profit on the last day when not holding any stock, as this will be the result after all transactions are completed, considering the cooldown period.  

This approach ensures that the buy and sell decisions are optimized across all days, taking into account the cooldown constraint to maximize the overall profit from the trading strategy.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][2];
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i]);
        }
        return dp[prices.length - 1][1];
    }
}
```

## Thought 3:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code represents a space-optimized solution to the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" problem using a dynamic programming approach. The goal is to maximize profit from trading stocks, where you can buy and sell the stock multiple times:  

Initialization of DP Array:  
A 1D array dp of size 2 is used, where:  
dp[0] stores the maximum profit achievable while holding a stock.  
dp[1] stores the maximum profit achievable while not holding a stock.  
Initially, dp[0] is set to -prices[0] to indicate buying the stock on the first day, and dp[1] is set to 0, indicating no transactions on the first day.  

Iterative Update:  
The algorithm iterates through the array prices from the second day onward.  
For each price on day i (where i starts from 1, hence prices[i-1] is used):  
Update dp[0] to be the maximum of the previous value of dp[0] (continuing to hold the stock) or the value of dp[1] minus the current price (buying the stock today).  
Update dp[1] to be the maximum of the previous value of dp[1] (not buying or selling today) or dp[0] plus the current price (selling the stock today).  

Returning the Result:  
The function returns dp[1] at the end of the loop, which represents the maximum profit achievable without holding any stock at the end of the trading period.  

This approach efficiently computes the maximum profit using only constant space (O(1)) and in linear time relative to the number of days (O(n)), making it optimal for scenarios where you can buy one day and sell on any subsequent days.

## Solution 3:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int[] dp = new int[2];
        dp[0] = -prices[0];
        for(int i = 1; i <= prices.length; i++){
            dp[0] = Math.max(dp[0], dp[1] - prices[i - 1]);
            dp[1] = Math.max(dp[1], dp[0] + prices[i - 1]);
        }
        return dp[1];
    }
}
