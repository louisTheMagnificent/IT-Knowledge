## Question:

A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.  

For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.  
In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.  
A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.  

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]    
Output: 6  

Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]  
Output: 7  

Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.  
One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).   

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]  
Output: 2  
 
Constraints:   

1 <= nums.length <= 1000  
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000   
 
Follow up: Could you solve this in O(n) time?

## Thought:
We use greedy to do it.

The Java code provided solves the problem of finding the maximum length of a wiggle sequence from a given array nums. A wiggle sequence is defined where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. Here's a concise explanation of the codeâ€™s strategy:  

Handle Base Case:  
If the array nums contains only one element, the function returns 1 because the length of the sequence is the single element itself.  

Initialize Variables:  
currdiff is used to store the current difference between consecutive elements.  
prediff is used to store the previous difference for comparison.  
result is initialized to 1 because at least one element (the first element) is always part of the wiggle sequence.  

Iterate Through the Array:  
Starting from the second element (index 1), calculate the difference between the current and the previous element (currdiff).  

Check if the current difference and the previous difference (prediff) form a wiggle:  
If currdiff is positive and prediff is less than or equal to zero or currdiff is negative and prediff is greater than or equal to zero, it indicates a valid wiggle point.  
Update prediff to the current difference and increment the result counter when a wiggle is detected.  

Return the Result:  
The variable result counts the number of times a wiggle occurs, including the first element, and is returned as the maximum length of the wiggle sequence.  

This approach efficiently determines the length of the wiggle sequence by iterating through the array once (O(n) complexity) and checking the sign changes between consecutive differences, updating the count whenever a valid wiggle transition is found.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 1) return nums.length; 
        int currdiff = 0;
        int prediff = 0;
        int result = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            currdiff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1];
            if((currdiff > 0 && prediff <= 0) || (currdiff < 0 && prediff >= 0)){
                prediff = currdiff;
                result++;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
