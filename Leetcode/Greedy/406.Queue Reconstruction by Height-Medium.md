## Question:

You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.  

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).  

Example 1:  

Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]  
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]  

Explanation:  
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.  
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.  
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.  
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.  
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.  
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.  
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.  

Example 2:  

Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]  
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= people.length <= 2000  
0 <= hi <= 106  
0 <= ki < people.length

## Thought:
We use greedy to do it.  

This Java code is designed to solve the problem of reconstructing a queue based on the heights of people and the number of people in front of them who are taller or of the same height. Here's a brief overview of the code's logic:  

Sorting:  
The input array people is first sorted. Each person is represented as a two-element array, where the first element is the height and the second element is the count of people taller or of the same height standing in front of them.  
The array is sorted primarily in descending order by height. If two people have the same height, it is sorted in ascending order by the count of people in front.  

Reconstructing the Queue:  
After sorting, the code initializes an empty list to reconstruct the queue.  
It iterates over the sorted array and inserts each person into the list. The position to insert each person is determined by the second element of their array (the count of people in front), which aligns with their original description.  

Converting List to Array:  
Once the list is fully populated, it is converted back to an array using toArray(new int[people.length][]) method to match the expected return type.  

The sorting step ensures that taller individuals are placed first, and if two individuals are of the same height, the one with fewer people in front goes first. This guarantees that each person is inserted into the list at the correct position relative to others, effectively reconstructing the queue as described by the input conditions.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        Arrays.sort(people, (a,b) -> {
            if(a[0] == b[0])  return a[1] - b[1];
            return b[0] - a[0];
        });

        List<int[]> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < people.length; i++){
            list.add(people[i][1], people[i]);
        }

        return list.toArray(new int[people.length][]);
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(nlogn + <sup>n</sup>)  
Space complexity: O(n)
It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.
