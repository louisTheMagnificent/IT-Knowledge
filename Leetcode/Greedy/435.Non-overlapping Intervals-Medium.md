## Question:

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.  

Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.  

Example 1:  

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]  
Output: 1  

Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.  

Example 2:  

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]  
Output: 2  

Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.  

Example 3:  

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]  
Output: 0  

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= intervals.length <= 105  
intervals[i].length == 2  
-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104

## Thought:
We use greedy to do it.  

This Java code solves the problem of removing the minimum number of intervals so that the remaining intervals do not overlap. The main steps of the solution's design are:  

Sorting the Intervals:  
The intervals are sorted based on their start coordinates using Arrays.sort. This allows the algorithm to process intervals in a sequential order, facilitating easier detection of overlaps.  

Greedy Algorithm to Identify Non-Overlapping Intervals:  
The method employs a greedy algorithm to identify the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals. It iterates through the sorted list of intervals, attempting to keep as many non-overlapping intervals as possible.  
currFurthest tracks the end of the current interval, and count keeps track of the number of non-overlapping intervals identified.  

Count Overlapping by Tracking Ends:  
For each interval in the sorted list, the algorithm checks for overlaps with the subsequent interval. If the next interval starts before the current one ends (currFurthest), the end of the current valid range is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the next interval's end.  
When an overlap is detected, the loop skips to the next interval that does not overlap with the current furthest end.  

Calculate and Return the Number of Removed Intervals:  
After processing all intervals, the number of non-overlapping intervals (count) is subtracted from the total number of intervals to determine how many intervals were removed.  

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and straightforward, by first sorting the intervals and then using a greedy method to count the maximal set of non-overlapping intervals. The result is the minimal number of intervals that need to be removed to eliminate all overlaps.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> {
            return Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]);
        });

        int i = 0;
        int currFurthest = 0;
        int count = 0;
        while(i < intervals.length){
            currFurthest = intervals[i][1];
            int j = i + 1;
            while(j < intervals.length && intervals[j][0] < currFurthest){
                currFurthest = Math.min(currFurthest, intervals[j][1]);
                j++;
            }
            count++;
            i = j;
        }
        return intervals.length - count;
    }
}
```
