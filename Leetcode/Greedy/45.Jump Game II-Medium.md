## Question:

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].  

Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:  

0 <= j <= nums[i] and  
i + j < n  
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]  
Output: 2  

Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]  
Output: 2  

Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 104  
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000  
It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].

## Thought: 

The provided Java code implements a greedy algorithm to solve the "Jump Game II" problem, which aims to determine the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last element from the first in an array where each element indicates the maximum jump length from that position. The solution maintains three variables: jumps to count the number of jumps, currEnd to mark the farthest position reachable without an additional jump, and currFarthest for the farthest position reachable with the next potential jump. As the array is traversed, currFarthest is updated to the maximum reach from the current index. When the traversal reaches currEnd, a jump is made, currEnd is updated to currFarthest, and jumps is incremented. The loop breaks early if currEnd exceeds the array's length, ensuring efficiency. The result returned is the total number of jumps needed to reach the end of the array.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int jumps = 0;
        int currEnd = 0;
        int currFarthest = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++){
            currFarthest = Math.max(currFarthest, i + nums[i]);

            if(i == currEnd){
                jumps++;
                currEnd = currFarthest;
                if(currEnd >= nums.length) break;
            }
        }
        return jumps;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
