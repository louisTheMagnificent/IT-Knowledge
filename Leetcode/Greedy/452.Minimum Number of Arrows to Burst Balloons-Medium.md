## Question:

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.  

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.  

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.  

Example 1:  

Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]  
Output: 2  

Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:  
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].  
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
  
Example 2:  

Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]  
Output: 4  

Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.  

Example 3:

Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]  
Output: 2  

Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:  
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].  
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= points.length <= 105  
points[i].length == 2  
-231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1

## Thought:
We use greedy to do it.

This Java code solves the problem of finding the minimum number of arrows required to burst all balloons represented by intervals in the points array. Each interval or point represents a balloon with a specific start and end coordinate. Here's a concise overview of the solution's logic:  

Sorting the Intervals:  
The intervals are sorted by their start coordinates using Arrays.sort. If two intervals have the same start coordinate, they are naturally sorted by end coordinate due to the behavior of Integer.compare.  

Iterating Through Intervals:  
The algorithm uses a greedy approach to minimize the number of arrows. It starts by initializing the currFurthest variable, which tracks the furthest point an arrow can reach and still burst all balloons encountered so far.  
A counter count is used to keep track of the number of arrows needed.  

Greedy Arrow Placement:  
For each interval in the sorted list, the code checks how far an arrow starting at the current interval's start can go without missing any balloons. This is determined by continuously updating currFurthest to be the minimum of its current value and the end coordinate of the next overlapping balloon.  
When no more balloons overlap with the current furthest point that can be reached by an arrow, an arrow is counted (incrementing count), and the search continues from the next balloon that couldn't be reached by the previous arrow.  

Counting Arrows:  
The loop continues until all balloons have been accounted for, and the total number of arrows required is returned.  
This approach ensures that the minimum number of arrows is used by always placing an arrow in such a way that it bursts the maximum number of overlapping balloons, starting from the earliest possible balloon.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) ->{
            return Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]);
        });
        int currFurthest = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int count = 0;
        while(i < points.length){
            currFurthest = points[i][1];
            int j = i + 1;
            while(j < points.length && points[j][0] <= currFurthest){
                currFurthest = Math.min(currFurthest, points[j][1]);
                j++;
            }
            count++;
            i = j;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
