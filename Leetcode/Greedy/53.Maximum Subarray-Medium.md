## Question:

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.   

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]  
Output: 6  

Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [1]  
Output: 1  

Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.  

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]  
Output: 23  

Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.  

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105  
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104  

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

## Thought 1:
We use greedy to do it.

This Java code implements the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a given one-dimensional integer array. It initializes result to the smallest possible integer value to ensure that it can handle any array elements. The variable count keeps track of the current sum of the subarray as the loop iterates over the array. For each element, count is updated by adding the current element. If the updated count is greater than result, then result is updated to be the current count. If count becomes negative, it is reset to zero, because a negative sum will not contribute to a maximum subarray starting from the next element. The algorithm returns result, which will contain the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray by the end of the loop.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int result = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int count = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            count += nums[i];
            result = Math.max(result, count);

            if(count < 0){
                count = 0;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Thought 2
We use 1d dp to do it.

This Java code implements the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum subarray within a given array of integers. The approach uses dynamic programming. Here, an array dp is used to store the maximum subarray sum ending at each index. The algorithm initializes the first element of dp with the first element of the input array nums. For each subsequent element, the algorithm decides whether to add the current element to the existing subarray or start a new subarray with the current element. This decision is made using Math.max(dp[i - 1] + nums[i], nums[i]). The variable result tracks the maximum value found in the dp array, which is the maximum sum of any subarray in the input array. The final result is the value of this maximum sum.

---
## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        dp[0] = nums[0];
        int result = nums[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1] + nums[i], nums[i]);
            if(dp[i] > result) result = dp[i];
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Thought 3:
We use 1d dp to do it but only constant space complexity.

This Java code is a streamlined version of the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum subarray in a given array of integers. It employs dynamic programming but optimizes space usage by using a single integer dp to keep track of the maximum subarray sum ending at the current index, instead of using an array. The code initializes dp and result with the first element of the input array nums. For each subsequent element, dp is updated to the maximum of dp + nums[i] (adding the current element to the existing subarray) or nums[i] (starting a new subarray with the current element). If dp exceeds result, result is updated to dp. Finally, result holds the maximum sum of any subarray found in the input array.

## Solution 3:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int dp = nums[0];
        int result = nums[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            dp = Math.max(dp + nums[i], nums[i]);
            if(dp > result) result = dp;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
