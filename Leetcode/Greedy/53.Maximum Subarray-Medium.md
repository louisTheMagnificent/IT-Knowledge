## Question:

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.   

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]  
Output: 6  

Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [1]  
Output: 1  

Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.  

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]  
Output: 23  

Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.  

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105  
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104  

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

## Thought:
We use greedy to do it.

This Java code implements the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a given one-dimensional integer array. It initializes result to the smallest possible integer value to ensure that it can handle any array elements. The variable count keeps track of the current sum of the subarray as the loop iterates over the array. For each element, count is updated by adding the current element. If the updated count is greater than result, then result is updated to be the current count. If count becomes negative, it is reset to zero, because a negative sum will not contribute to a maximum subarray starting from the next element. The algorithm returns result, which will contain the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray by the end of the loop.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int result = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int count = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            count += nums[i];
            result = Math.max(result, count);

            if(count < 0){
                count = 0;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
