## Question:

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.  

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]  
Output: true  

Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]  
Output: false  

Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 104  
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

## Thought:
We keep tracking what is the most steps the current index could travel. We choose the larger one of current max and the current number. If 
we could get to the last number, we return true. If the current max is 0, return false. When we move to the next value, current max minus 1.

---
## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 1) return true;
        int currentMax = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++){
            currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], currentMax);
            if(currentMax + i >= nums.length - 1) return true;
            else if(currentMax == 0) return false;
            currentMax--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(1)
