## Question:

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.  

Example 1:  

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]  
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]  

Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].  

Example 2:  
 
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]  
Output: [[1,5]]  

Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.  

Constraints:  

1 <= intervals.length <= 104  
intervals[i].length == 2  
0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

## Thought:
We use greedy to do it.  

This Java code solves the problem of merging overlapping intervals. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the solution's logic:  

Sort Intervals:  
The code starts by sorting the intervals array based on the starting points of each interval using Arrays.sort. This sorting ensures that any overlapping intervals are adjacent in the array, simplifying the merging process.  

Initialize Variables:  
The variables start and currMax are initialized with the start and end of the first interval, respectively. These variables track the current interval being formed as potential merges are considered.  

Iterate and Merge:  
The code iterates through the sorted intervals. For each interval:  
If the current interval's start is greater than currMax, it indicates there is no overlap with the current interval being formed. The current interval is then finalized and added to the list, and start and currMax are updated to the new interval's values.  
If there is an overlap (i.e., the current interval's start is less than or equal to currMax), currMax is updated to be the maximum of its current value or the current interval's end, effectively merging the intervals.  

Finalize Last Interval:  
After exiting the loop, the last interval being formed is added to the list. This step is necessary because the final interval might still be pending when the iteration completes.  

Convert List to Array:  
The list of merged intervals is converted back into a 2D array format to match the expected output format using list.toArray.  

This approach ensures that all overlapping intervals are merged efficiently in a single pass through the sorted list, leveraging the sort-then-merge strategy commonly used for these types of problems.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> {
            return Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]);
        });

        int start = intervals[0][0];
        int currMax = intervals[0][1];
        List<int[]> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++){
            if(intervals[i][0] > currMax){
                int[] newArray = new int[2];
                newArray[0] = start;
                newArray[1] = currMax;
                list.add(newArray);
                start = intervals[i][0];
                currMax = intervals[i][1];
            }
            else{
                currMax = Math.max(currMax, intervals[i][1]);
            }
            if(i == intervals.length - 1){
                int[] newArray = new int[2];
                newArray[0] = start;
                newArray[1] = currMax;   
                list.add(newArray);             
            }
        }

        return list.toArray(new int[list.size()][]);
    }
}
```
