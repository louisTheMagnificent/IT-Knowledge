## Question:

An integer has monotone increasing digits if and only if each pair of adjacent digits x and y satisfy x <= y.  

Given an integer n, return the largest number that is less than or equal to n with monotone increasing digits.  

Example 1:  

Input: n = 10  
Output: 9  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 1234  
Output: 1234  

Example 3:  

Input: n = 332  
Output: 299  
 
Constraints:  

0 <= n <= 109

## Thought:
We use greedy to do it.  

This Java code provides a solution to find the largest monotone increasing number that is less than or equal to a given number n. Here's a concise explanation of the approach:  

Convert Number to Character Array:  
The number n is converted into a string and then into a character array to facilitate manipulation of individual digits.  

Identify Non-Monotone Position:  
The code iterates through the character array from right to left (starting from the second last digit), comparing each digit with the one following it.  
If a digit is found that is greater than the next digit (chars[i] > chars[i + 1]), it means the sequence is not monotone increasing at that point. The code then decrements the digit (chars[i]--) and records the position (start = i + 1) where the digits need to be set to '9' to ensure the result is the largest possible monotone increasing number.  

Modify Digits After Non-Monotone Point:  
From the start position recorded, the code sets all subsequent digits to '9'. This step ensures that after the decrement, the number formed is the largest possible number that remains monotone increasing.  

Convert Character Array Back to Integer:  
The modified character array is converted back to a string and then parsed into an integer, which is returned as the result.  

This approach efficiently modifies the given number to make it the largest possible monotone increasing number by adjusting only the necessary digits and avoids the need for a brute-force search.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int monotoneIncreasingDigits(int n) {
        String s = String.valueOf(n);
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        int length = chars.length;
        int start = length;
        for(int i = length - 2; i >= 0; i--){
            if(chars[i] > chars[i + 1]){
                chars[i]--;
                start = i + 1;
            }
        }
        for(int i = start; i < length; i++){
            chars[i] = '9';
        }

        return Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(chars));
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(Number of digits of n)  
Space complexity: O(Number of digits of n)
