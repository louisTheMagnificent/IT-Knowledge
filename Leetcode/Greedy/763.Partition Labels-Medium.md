## Question:

You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.  

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.  

Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"  
Output: [9,7,8]  

Explanation:  
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".  
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.  
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"  
Output: [10]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 500  
s consists of lowercase English letters.

## Thought 1:
We use greedy to do it.  

This Java code implements a solution for partitioning a string into the fewest number of segments such that the letters in each segment appear in that segment and nowhere else. Here’s a brief overview of how the code works:  

Map Characters to Their Ranges:  
The code first creates a HashMap to track the first and last indices ([0] and [1] respectively) of each character in the string s.  
It iterates over the string, updating the map with the first occurrence and continuously updating the last occurrence of each character.  

Convert Map to Intervals Array:  
It then converts this map into a 2D array intervals, where each entry contains the start and end indices of a character's range in the string.  

Sort Intervals by Start Index:  
The intervals array is sorted based on the start indices of each range, facilitating the merging process in the next step.  

Merge Intervals and Calculate Segment Lengths:  
The code initializes variables to track the current furthest index (currFurthest) and uses a while loop to merge overlapping intervals.  
For each interval starting at i, it checks subsequent intervals to see if they overlap with the current interval (currFurthest). If they do, it updates the currFurthest to the maximum end index found.  
After determining the furthest reach for the current starting interval, it calculates the length of this segment and adds it to the result list.  
It then skips to the next non-overlapping interval and repeats the process.  

Return Result:  
Finally, the function returns a list of segment lengths, each representing a part of the string that contains unique characters without overlap in other segments.  

This solution efficiently determines the minimal number of contiguous segments needed, where each segment's characters do not appear in any other segment.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String s) {
        Map<Character, int[]> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            if(!map.containsKey(s.charAt(i))){
                int[] newArray = new int[2];
                newArray[0] = i;
                newArray[1] = i;
                map.put(s.charAt(i), newArray);
            }
            else{
                int[] array = map.get(s.charAt(i));
                array[1] = i;
            }
        }

        int[][] intervals = new int[map.size()][2];
        int i = 0;
        for(Map.Entry<Character, int[]> entry : map.entrySet()){
            intervals[i] = entry.getValue();
            i++;
        }

        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> {
            return Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]);
        });

        i = 0;
        int currFurthest = 0;
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        while(i < intervals.length){
            currFurthest = intervals[i][1];
            int j = 1 + i;
            while(j < intervals.length && intervals[j][0] <= currFurthest){
                currFurthest = Math.max(currFurthest, intervals[j][1]);
                j++;
            }
            result.add(currFurthest - intervals[i][0] + 1);
            i = j;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:

This Java code implements a solution for partitioning a string into as few parts as possible such that no letters appear in more than one part, as specified in LeetCode problem 763, "Partition Labels." Here’s a concise overview of the code’s logic:  

Map Last Occurrences:  
The code first traverses the string s and creates a HashMap where each character from the string is mapped to its last occurring index in the string. This map will later help in determining the farthest point any segment can reach without splitting characters that appear multiple times.  

Initialize Tracking Variables:  
currLargest is initialized to track the furthest index that must be reached before a segment can be closed off.  
start keeps track of the starting index of the current segment.  

Determine Segments:  
The code iterates through the string again. For each character, it updates currLargest to be the maximum of its current value or the character's last occurrence index (found in the map).  
If the current index i matches currLargest, it means all characters in the current segment have been fully included up to this point, and no further occurrences of these characters are found later in the string.  
At this point, the length of the segment (currLargest - start + 1) is added to the result list, and start is updated to begin a new segment at currLargest + 1.  

Return Result:  
The list of segment lengths is returned, which represents the sizes of each contiguous substring that can be formed under the given constraints.  

This solution is efficient, leveraging a map for quick access to last occurrence indices and a single pass through the string to determine segment boundaries, making it optimal for large strings.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            map.put(s.charAt(i), i);
        }

        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int currLargest = 0;
        int start = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            currLargest = Math.max(currLargest, map.get(s.charAt(i)));
            if(i == currLargest){
                result.add(currLargest - start + 1);
                start = currLargest + 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
