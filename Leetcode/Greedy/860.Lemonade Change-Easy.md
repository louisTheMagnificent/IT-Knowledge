## Question:

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.  

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.  

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.  

Example 1:  

Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]  
Output: true  

Explanation:   
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.  
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.  
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.  
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.  

Example 2:  

Input: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]  
Output: false  

Explanation:   
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.  
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.  
For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.  
Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= bills.length <= 105  
bills[i] is either 5, 10, or 20.

## Thought:
We use greedy to do it.

This Java code solves the problem of determining if you can provide change for each customer using a limited supply of $5 and $10 bills when selling lemonades. Here’s a brief overview of the code’s logic:  

Initialization:  
Two counters are set up: numFive to count the number of $5 bills, and numTen for the $10 bills.  

Iterating Over Transactions:  
The code iterates through each transaction in the bills array. Depending on the denomination of the bill received from the customer ($5, $10, or $20), different actions are taken:  
If the bill is $5, it simply increments the numFive counter.  
If the bill is $10, it decrements numFive (as you need to give $5 as change) and increments numTen. If there aren’t enough $5 bills to give change, it returns false.  
If the bill is $20, the preferred change given is one $10 and one $5 bill. If a $10 bill is not available, it attempts to give three $5 bills as change. If the necessary change cannot be provided due to insufficient bills, it returns false.  

Result:  
If the loop completes without returning false, it means that you were able to provide the correct change for every transaction, and thus it returns true.  

This approach ensures that you always try to maintain an optimal mix of $5 and $10 bills to handle future transactions effectively. The method is efficient, running in linear time complexity O(n), where n is the number of transactions.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean lemonadeChange(int[] bills) {
        int numTen = 0;
        int numFive = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < bills.length; i++){
            if(bills[i] == 5){
                numFive++;
            }
            else if(bills[i] == 10){
                numFive--;
                numTen++;
                if(numFive < 0) return false;
            }
            else{
                numFive--;
                numTen--;
                if(numTen < 0){
                    numFive -= 2;
                    numTen++;
                }
                if(numFive < 0) return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
