## Question:

Given a circular integer array nums of length n, return the maximum possible sum of a non-empty subarray of nums.  

A circular array means the end of the array connects to the beginning of the array. Formally, the next element of nums[i] is nums[(i + 1) % n] and the previous element of nums[i] is nums[(i - 1 + n) % n].  

A subarray may only include each element of the fixed buffer nums at most once. Formally, for a subarray nums[i], nums[i + 1], ..., nums[j], there does not exist i <= k1, k2 <= j with k1 % n == k2 % n.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,-2,3,-2]  
Output: 3  

Explanation: Subarray [3] has maximum sum 3.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [5,-3,5]  
Output: 10  

Explanation: Subarray [5,5] has maximum sum 5 + 5 = 10.  

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [-3,-2,-3]  
Output: -2  

Explanation: Subarray [-2] has maximum sum -2.  
 
Constraints:  

n == nums.length  
1 <= n <= 3 * 104  
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104

## Thought:
We use greedy to do it.

Here's a brief overview of the design approach used in the provided Java code for solving the problem of finding the maximum sum of a circular subarray:  

Initialization:  
The code initializes variables n (the length of the array), currMax and currMin (to track the current maximum and minimum subarray sums), maxSum and minSum (to hold the global maximum and minimum subarray sums), and total (to accumulate the total sum of the array).  

Iteration over the Array:  
The loop iterates through each element of the array nums. For each element:  
currMax is updated to include the current element either by continuing the previous subarray or starting a new subarray from the current element, depending on which option gives a larger sum.  
Similarly, currMin is updated to include the current element by either continuing the previous subarray or starting a new one, based on which option results in a smaller sum.  
maxSum and minSum are updated to store the highest and lowest subarray sums found up to the current point in the array.  
total accumulates the sum of all elements in the array.  

Final Computation:  
After iterating through the array, the final result is computed based on whether there is a positive sum in the array:  
If maxSum is positive, it means there are beneficial subarrays to consider. The final maximum sum is then the greater of maxSum (the maximum subarray sum in the non-circular array) and total - minSum (which effectively gives the maximum sum of a circular subarray by subtracting the minimum subarray sum from the total sum).  
If maxSum is not positive (all elements are non-positive), it returns maxSum directly as no circular computation would yield a better result.  

This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity by effectively using a modified Kadane's algorithm to handle both the circular and non-circular subarray possibilities within a single pass through the array.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubarraySumCircular(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int currMax = 0, maxSum = nums[0], minSum = nums[0], currMin = 0, total = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            currMax = Math.max(currMax + nums[i], nums[i]);
            currMin = Math.min(currMin + nums[i], nums[i]);
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currMax);
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, currMin);
            total += nums[i];
        }

        return maxSum > 0 ? Math.max(total - minSum, maxSum) : maxSum;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
