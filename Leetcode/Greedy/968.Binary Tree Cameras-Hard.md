## Question:

You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.  

Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.  

Example 1:  

Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]  
Output: 1  

Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.  

Example 2:  

Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]  
Output: 2  

Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.  

Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].  
Node.val == 0

## Thought:
We use greedy to do it.  

This Java code is designed to solve the problem of placing the minimum number of cameras in a binary tree to monitor all nodes, as per the problem specification given in a coding challenge (often seen in problems like LeetCode's "Binary Tree Cameras"). Here's a concise overview of the solution's logic:  

Recursive Definition:  
The solution uses a recursive helper function monitor(TreeNode root) to determine the state of each node with respect to camera coverage. The function returns an integer representing the state of the node:  
0 indicates that the node requires a camera from its parent because it is not covered.  
1 indicates that the node has a camera.  
2 means the node is covered by a camera but doesn't have a camera itself.  

Base Case:  
If the node is null, it returns 2, indicating that a null node does not need coverage (implicitly covered).  

Recursive Traversal:  
The function recursively checks the left and right children of the current node. The values returned help decide the state of the current node.  
If either child returns 0 (indicating they are not covered), the current node must have a camera. Therefore, it places a camera at the current node (result++), and returns 1.  
If both children return 2 (both are covered but don't have cameras), then the current node is not covered and returns 0.  
In all other cases (i.e., if at least one child has a camera), the current node is covered and returns 2.  

Final Adjustment:  
After the recursive calls, if the root itself is returned as 0 (it's not covered), a camera is placed at the root, incrementing result by one more.  

Result:  
The variable result keeps track of the total number of cameras needed and is returned as the final result.  

This approach ensures that the minimum number of cameras are used by placing cameras at strategic positions (nodes where children are not covered). The recursion ensures that all nodes are either covered by a camera or have a camera themselves, following a bottom-up strategy to minimize the camera count effectively.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {

    private int result;
    public int minCameraCover(TreeNode root) {
        result = 0;
        if(monitor(root) == 0) result++;
        return result;
    }

    public int monitor(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null) return 2;

        int left = monitor(root.left);
        int right = monitor(root.right);
        
        if(left == 0 || right ==0){
            result++;
            return 1;
        }
        else if(left == 2 && right == 2){
            return 0;
        }
        else return 2;
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(Height of the tree)
