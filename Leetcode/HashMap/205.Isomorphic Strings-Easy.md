## Question:

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.  

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.  

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself. 

Example 1:  

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"  

Output: true  

Explanation:  

The strings s and t can be made identical by:  

Mapping 'e' to 'a'.  
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"  

Output: false  

Explanation:  

The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.  

Example 3:  

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"  

Output: true   

Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104  
t.length == s.length  
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.

## Thought:
We use hashMap to store the mappings. There are four situation. First, if current letter in s is not a key and current letter in t is not a value, 
we store them in map. Second, if current letter in s is not a key but current letter in t is already a value, we return false. Third, if current letter 
in s is a key and its value is the current letter in t, we continue. Fourth, if the current letter in s is a key but its value is not the current 
letter in t, we return false.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        Map<Character, Character> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            if(!hashMap.containsKey(s.charAt(i)) && !hashMap.containsValue(t.charAt(i))){
                hashMap.put(s.charAt(i), t.charAt(i));
            }
            else if(!hashMap.containsKey(s.charAt(i)) && hashMap.containsValue(t.charAt(i))){
                return false;
            }
            else if(hashMap.get(s.charAt(i)) != t.charAt(i)){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
