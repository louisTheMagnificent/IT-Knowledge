## Question:

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3  

Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.  

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1  

Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.  

Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3  

Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 
Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104  
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Thought:
We use a hashmap to store the character and its newest possition index. We traverse the string only once and we set an index to keep 
the string between the current character and the index is not repeated. When the current character is not stored in the hashmap or
it is shown before the index, we renew the hashmap and calculate the current substring's length and compare with the current maxLength
and we choose the larger one to renew current maxLength. If it is shown in the current substring, we set the index as the next character of 
current traversed character and renew the hashmap.

## Solution:  
```Java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int max = 0;
        int index = 0;
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            if(!map.containsKey(s.charAt(i)) || map.get(s.charAt(i)) < index){
                map.put(s.charAt(i),i);
                max = Math.max(max, i - index + 1);
            }
            else{
                index = map.get(s.charAt(i)) + 1;
                map.put(s.charAt(i),i);
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
