## Question: 

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]  
Output: [2,2]

Example 2:  

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]  
Output: [4,9]  

Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000  
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000  
 
Follow up:  

What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?  
What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?  
What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

## Thought:
We use a hashmap to do it. This Java code defines a method intersect that finds the intersection of two integer arrays, nums1 and nums2, returning all elements that appear in both arrays, including duplicates.  
The approach uses a HashMap to track the frequency of each element in nums1. As the code iterates through nums1, it populates the map, incrementing the count for each element found.  
Next, a List is created to store the result elements. As the method iterates through nums2, it checks if each element exists in the map (i.e., it was also in nums1). If it does, the element is added to the list, and its count in the map is decremented. If the count reaches zero after decrementing, the element is removed from the map to prevent further matches with the same element. The iteration through nums2 breaks early if the map becomes empty, indicating all matching elements have been found.  
Finally, the list of intersection elements is converted into an array. This is accomplished by creating an array result of the same size as the list and then copying elements from the list into the array.  
This method ensures that the intersection contains duplicates if they appear in both input arrays and efficiently terminates once all possible matches have been found.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] intersect(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int num : nums1){
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int num : nums2){
            if(map.containsKey(num)){
                list.add(num);
                map.put(num, map.get(num) - 1);
                if(map.get(num) == 0) map.remove(num);
                if(map.isEmpty()) break;
            }
        }

        int[] result = new int[list.size()];
        for(int i = 0; i < result.length; i++){
            result[i] = list.get(i);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(m + n + result.length)  
Space complexity: O(n + result.length)
