## Question

Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: 0

Explanation:

The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.

Example 2:

Input: s = "loveleetcode"

Output: 2

Example 3:

Input: s = "aabb"

Output: -1

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105  
s consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Thought:
We use hashmap to do it. We first iterates through the string to build a HashMap, storing each character's frequency. Then, it performs a second pass to find the first character with a count of 1 and returns its index. If no unique character is found, it returns -1. This approach ensures an efficient O(n) solution by leveraging the HashMap for quick lookups.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
        if(s.length() == 1) return 0;
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            if(!map.containsKey(s.charAt(i))){
                map.put(s.charAt(i), 1);
            }
            else{
                map.put(s.charAt(i), map.get(s.charAt(i)) + 1);
            }
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            if(map.get(s.charAt(i)) == 1) return i;
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
