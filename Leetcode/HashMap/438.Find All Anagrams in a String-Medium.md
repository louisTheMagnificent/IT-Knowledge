## Question:

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"  
Output: [0,6]  

Explanation:  
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".  
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"  
Output: [0,1,2]  

Explanation:  
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".  
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".  
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104  
s and p consist of lowercase English letters.

## Thought:
We use a hashmap and fast slow pointers to do it. This Java code defines a method findAnagrams that identifies all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. The method returns a list of indices where each anagram of p begins within s.  
The approach utilizes a sliding window technique along with a hashmap to track the frequency of characters in p. The hashmap (map) is initially populated with the character frequencies of p. As the fast pointer moves through s, the method adjusts the counts in the map based on the characters at the current position.  
If the character pointed to by fast is not in the map, the window is reset. The window's start position (slow) is moved right past fast, and all character counts are restored up to fast.  
If the character is in the map, its count is decremented. If the count drops below zero, it indicates there are more of that character in the window than in p. The slow pointer is then moved to the right, incrementing character counts, until the excess character is removed from the window.  
If the window size matches the length of p and all character counts are correct (i.e., none are negative), it means an anagram is found at the position marked by slow. The start position is added to the result list, and the window is adjusted by moving slow right and updating the count for the character at slow.  
The method efficiently scans s using two pointers (slow and fast) that adjust the window on the string to find all occurrences of anagrams of p. It returns the list of starting indices of these anagrams in s.

## Soltuion:
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findAnagrams(String s, String p) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if(p.length() > s.length()) return result;
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(char c : p.toCharArray()){
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        int slow = 0;
        int fast = 0;
        while(fast < s.length()){
            if(!map.containsKey(s.charAt(fast))){
                while(slow < fast){
                    map.put(s.charAt(slow), map.get(s.charAt(slow)) + 1);
                    slow++;
                }
                slow++;
            }
            else{
                map.put(s.charAt(fast), map.get(s.charAt(fast)) - 1);
                if(map.get(s.charAt(fast)) < 0){
                    while(map.get(s.charAt(fast)) < 0){
                        map.put(s.charAt(slow), map.get(s.charAt(slow)) + 1);
                        slow++;
                    }
                }
                if(fast - slow == p.length() - 1){
                    result.add(slow);
                    map.put(s.charAt(slow), map.get(s.charAt(slow)) + 1);
                    slow++;
                }
            }
            fast++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
