## Question:

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order. 

Example 1:  

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]  

Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]  

Explanation:  

There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".  
The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.  
The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.  

Example 2:  

Input: strs = [""]  

Output: [[""]]  

Example 3:  

Input: strs = ["a"]  

Output: [["a"]]  

Constraints:  

1 <= strs.length <= 104  
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100  
strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

## Thought:
We use hashMap to do it. For each str, we convert it into sorted str and make it as a key, the related value is a list which stores 
the original str which has the same sorted str. Finally we add all the value into a new list and return it.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(String word : strs){
            char[] toChar = word.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(toChar);
            String newString = new String(toChar);
            List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
            if(!map.containsKey(newString)){
                list.add(word);
                map.put(newString, list);
            }
            else{
                map.get(newString).add(word);
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(nlogm)(n is the number of strs and m is the length of str)  
Space complexity: O(n)
