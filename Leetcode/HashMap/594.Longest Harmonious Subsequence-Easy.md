## Question:

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.  

Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.   

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]  

Output: 5  

Explanation:  

The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]  

Output: 2  

Explanation:  

The longest harmonious subsequences are [1,2], [2,3], and [3,4], all of which have a length of 2.  

Example 3:  

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]  

Output: 0  

Explanation:  

No harmonic subsequence exists.   

Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104  
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Thought:
We use hashmap to record the times of apperance of a element in the array. And we calculate the times of a number and the number + 1 if it is a key. 
We keep the largest sum and return.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int findLHS(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int result = 0;
        
        for(int i : nums){
            map.put(i, map.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        }

        for(int i : nums){
            if(map.containsKey(i + 1)){
                result = Math.max(result, map.get(i) + map.get(i + 1));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)
