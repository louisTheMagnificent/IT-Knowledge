## Question:

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.  

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]  
Output: 4  

Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]  
Output: 9  

Constraints:  

0 <= nums.length <= 105  
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Thought:
We use a hashSet to do it. First we add all the elements into the hashSet. Then we traverse the array again. For each number, we check if it is 
the start of the consecutive sequence by checking whether number - 1 is in the hashSet. If not, current number is the start, then we start to count 
how many consecutive numbers in the hashSet started by current number. We set a current length, then we check whether number + length is in the hashSet. If so, length++. 
If not, compare the current length with the current longest length. If larger, renew the longest length.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 0 || nums.length == 1) return nums.length;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(int num : nums){
            set.add(num);
        }
        int longest = 1;
        for(int num : nums){
            if(!set.contains(num - 1)){
                int length = 1;
                while(set.contains(num + length)){
                    length++;
                }
                if(length > longest) longest = length;
            }
        }
        return longest;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)
