## Question:

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.   

Example 1:  

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]  
Output: [2]  

Example 2:  

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]  
Output: [9,4]  

Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000  
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

## Thought:
We use a hashset to do it. This Java code defines a method intersection that finds the intersection of two integer arrays, nums1 and nums2, returning the unique common elements as an integer array.  
The method uses a HashSet to store elements from the first array (nums1). As it iterates through nums1, each element is added to the set only if it is not already present, ensuring all elements are unique.  
Next, a List is created to collect elements that are common to both arrays. As the method iterates through the second array (nums2), it checks if each element exists in the set. If it does, the element is added to the list and then removed from the set to prevent duplicate entries in the result and to optimize further searches. The loop breaks early if the set becomes empty, indicating all potential intersections have been found.  
Finally, the list of intersection elements is converted into an array. This is done by creating an array result of the same size as the list, and then populating it with the elements from the list.  
This method efficiently computes the intersection of two arrays with unique results and is optimized by early termination when all intersecting elements are found.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] intersection(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(int num : nums1){
            if(!set.contains(num)) set.add(num);
        }

        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int num : nums2){
            if(set.contains(num)){
                list.add(num);
                set.remove(num);
                if(set.isEmpty()) break;
            }
        }

        int[] result = new int[list.size()];
        for(int i = 0; i < result.length; i++){
            result[i] = list.get(i);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n + m + result.length)  
Space complexity: O(n + result.length)
