## Question:

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.  

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.   

Example 1:  

Input: n = 10  
Output: 12  

Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 1  
Output: 1  

Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= n <= 1690

## Thought 1:
We use a heap to do it. 
This Java code implements a function to find the nth ugly number using a min-heap and a hash set. An ugly number is defined as a number that has only 2, 3, or 5 as its prime factors. The method initializes with a priority queue (min-heap) and a hash set to track and ensure that each ugly number is only processed once.  
The process starts by adding the first ugly number, which is 1, into both the min-heap and the set. The algorithm then enters a loop that continues until the nth ugly number is found. In each iteration of the loop, the smallest number is removed from the min-heap and multiplied by each of the primes (2, 3, and 5) to generate new ugly numbers.  
Each newly generated number is checked against the set to avoid duplicates. If it's not already in the set, it is added to both the set and the min-heap. This ensures that every number in the min-heap is unique and generated in increasing order. The loop runs until we reach the nth iteration, at which point the smallest element in the min-heap, which is the nth ugly number, is returned.  
This method efficiently computes ugly numbers by using the properties of the min-heap for ordered retrieval and the set for membership checking, ensuring optimal generation and retrieval of sequential ugly numbers.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        int[] primes = {2,3,5};
        PriorityQueue<Long> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        Set<Long> set = new HashSet<>();

        minHeap.add(1L);
        set.add(1L);
        while(n-- > 1){
            long curr = minHeap.poll();
            for(int prime: primes){
                long newUgly = curr * prime;
                if(!set.contains(newUgly)){
                    set.add(newUgly);
                    minHeap.add(newUgly);
                }
            }
        }
        long result = minHeap.poll();
        return (int) result;
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use 1D DP to do it. 
This Java code implements a method to find the nth ugly number using a dynamic programming approach with the assistance of a list and three indices. Ugly numbers are defined as positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, or 5. The main concepts of the implementation are as follows:  
Initialization: A list is initialized with the first ugly number, which is 1. Three indices are used to track the position of the next number to multiply by 2, 3, and 5 respectively.  
Iterative Generation: The code iteratively computes potential ugly numbers by multiplying the number at each of the three indices' positions with their respective primes (2, 3, and 5). It then selects the smallest number from these potential ugly numbers as the next ugly number.  
Minimization and Update: After determining the smallest new ugly number, it is added to the list of ugly numbers. The indices corresponding to the primes that produced this minimum value are incremented, ensuring that each prime factor contributes to generating subsequent ugly numbers without duplication.  
Final Output: After looping through the required number of times (n times), the nth ugly number is retrieved from the list and returned. This approach ensures that all ugly numbers are generated in a sequential and sorted manner due to the careful incrementation of indices and selection of the minimum ugly number at each step.  
This method is efficient in maintaining a growing list of ugly numbers while ensuring that each new number is the smallest possible next ugly number, produced by multiplying a previously identified ugly number by one of the prime factors.

        int[] primes = {2,3,5};
        int[] indices = {0,0,0};
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add(1);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            int[] newUgly = {
                list.get(indices[0]) * primes[0],
                list.get(indices[1]) * primes[1],
                list.get(indices[2]) * primes[2]
            };
            int curr = Math.min(newUgly[0], Math.min(newUgly[1], newUgly[2]));
            list.add(curr);
            for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++){
                if(newUgly[j] == curr){
                    indices[j]++;
                }
            }
        }
        return list.get(n - 1);
    }
}
