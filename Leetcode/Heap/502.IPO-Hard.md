## Question:

Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.  

You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.  

Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.  

Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.  

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.  

Example 1:  

Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]  
Output: 4  

Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.  
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.  
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.  
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.  
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.  

Example 2:  

Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]  
Output: 6  

Constraints:  

1 <= k <= 105  
0 <= w <= 109  
n == profits.length  
n == capital.length  
1 <= n <= 105  
0 <= profits[i] <= 104  
0 <= capital[i] <= 109

## Thought:
We use a heap to do it. This Java code is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to maximize capital by making up to k investments from a given set of projects. Each project requires a certain capital and offers a profit.  
Initialization: Two arrays, profits and capital, are merged into a single 2D array where each element consists of a project's required capital and its potential profit.  
Sorting: The merged array is sorted based on the required capital to facilitate the sequential access of projects as capital accumulates.  
Priority Queue: A max heap (priority queue in reverse order) is used to keep track of the projects' profits that can be started with the available capital.  
Investment Process: The algorithm iterates up to k times or until it runs out of suitable projects. In each iteration, it adds all the projects that can be started with the current capital to the max heap. The project with the highest profit is then selected from the heap (if available), and the capital is increased by the profit of that project.  
Result: The loop continues until either all k investments are made or there are no more projects that can be started with the available capital. The final amount of capital after all possible investments is returned.  
This method efficiently finds the best projects to invest in by always picking the project with the highest available profit, using a priority queue to manage project selection dynamically as capital increases.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, int[] profits, int[] capital) {
        int result = w;
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());

        int[][] merge = new int[profits.length][2];

        for(int i = 0; i < profits.length; i++){
            merge[i][0] = capital[i];
            merge[i][1] = profits[i];
        }

        Arrays.sort(merge, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        int i = 0;

        while(k-- > 0){
            while(i < profits.length && merge[i][0] <= w){
                maxHeap.offer(merge[i][1]);
                i++;
            }
            if(maxHeap.isEmpty()) break;
            w += maxHeap.poll();
        }

        return w;
    }
}
```
