## Question: 

Given a string s, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

Example 1:  

Input: s = "abab"  
Output: true  

Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "aba"    
Output: false  

Example 3: 

Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"  
Output: true  

Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 104  
s consists of lowercase English letters.

## Thought: 
We use KMP to do it. 
This Java code defines a method called repeatedSubstringPattern that determines whether a given string s is composed of one substring repeated multiple times. The method leverages the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm's partial match table (also known as the longest prefix suffix table or LPS table) to achieve this.  
Detailed steps of the design strategy are as follows:  
Initialization of the Partial Match Table:  
Create an array next of the same length as the string s to store the length of the longest prefix that is also a suffix for each position.  
Invoke the getNext method to populate this next array.  
Building the Partial Match Table:  
In the getNext method, use two pointers, i and j, to traverse the string s.  
Start i at 1, representing the current position in the next array to be filled, while j represents the length of the current longest matching prefix.  
If s[i] matches s[j], increment j and set next[i] = j.  
If there is a mismatch and j is greater than 0, update j to next[j-1], which is the length of the longest matching prefix for the substring considered previously.  
Repeat this process until the entire string s has been traversed.    
Determining the Repeated Substring Pattern:  
In the repeatedSubstringPattern method, check the value of the last element in the next array next[next.length - 1].  
If this value is greater than 0 and the length of the string s is divisible by (s.length() - next[next.length - 1]), return true, indicating that string s can be composed of a shorter substring repeated multiple times.  
Otherwise, return false, indicating that s cannot be composed of any repeated substring.  
The core of this method is to use the KMP algorithm's partial match table to quickly determine whether a string has a repeated substring pattern by analyzing the string's self-repetitive properties. This approach avoids the high time complexity associated with simple brute-force matching methods.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean repeatedSubstringPattern(String s) {
        int[] next = new int[s.length()];
        getNext(next, s);
        if(next[next.length - 1] > 0 && s.length() % (s.length() - next[next.length - 1]) == 0) return true;
        else return false; 
    }

    public void getNext(int[] next, String s){
        int j = 0;
        next[0] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++){
            while(j > 0 && s.charAt(j) != s.charAt(i)){
                j = next[j - 1];
            }
            if(s.charAt(j) == s.charAt(i)){
                j++;
            }
            next[i] = j;
        }
        return;
    }
}
```
