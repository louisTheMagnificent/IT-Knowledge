## Question: 

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.  

Example 1:  

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]  
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]  

Example 2:  

Input: head = [1,2]  
Output: [2,1]  

Example 3:

Input: head = []  
Output: []  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].  
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000  
 
Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## Thought 1: 
We do it iteratively. The code first checks if the list is either empty (head == null) or contains only one node (head.next == null), in which case it returns the head directly as there is no need for reversal.  
Next, two pointers, slow and fast, are defined. slow is initialized to the head node, head, and fast is initialized to the next node, head.next. These pointers help in traversing the list and re-linking the nodes.  
During the traversal, the next node of the fast pointer is first saved to the variable next. This is done to maintain access to the next node after the links have been changed. Then, the list reversal operation is performed: if slow is the head node, its next is set to null (as it will become the tail node after the reversal). Then, the fast node's next is set to point to slow, effectively reversing the link. Finally, the slow and fast pointers are moved to the next positions, with slow moving to fast, and fast moving to next.  
When the traversal ends, fast will be null, and the slow pointer will point to the new head node, as it has become the first node of the reversed list. The method then returns slow as the new head node.

## Solution 1:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head.next;
        while(fast != null){
            ListNode next = fast.next;
            if(slow == head) slow.next = null;
            fast.next = slow;
            slow = fast;
            fast = next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We do it recursively. This Java code is a recursive implementation of a function to reverse a singly linked list. It consists of a public method reverseList and a private helper method reverse, used to recursively reverse the nodes in the list.    
The public method reverseList takes the head node of the list, head, as a parameter. If the head node is null, indicating the list is empty, it directly returns null. Otherwise, it calls the reverse method to start the recursive process, passing null as the previous node (since the last node in the reversed list should point to null) and the head node head as the current node.  
The private method reverse performs the actual reversal logic and accepts two parameters: prev (the previous node) and curr (the current node). If the current node curr is null, it means the end of the original list has been reached, and at this point, prev is returned since it will be the head node of the new reversed list. Otherwise, the process continues with the following operations:  
Save the next node of curr to the variable next, as we need to continue processing the rest of the list after disconnecting and reconnecting the nodes.  
Modify the next pointer of the current node curr to point to the previous node prev, achieving the reversal.  
Recursively call the reverse method, now with curr becoming the new prev, and next becoming the new curr.  
The recursion continues until the entire list is reversed. Ultimately, when recursion reaches the end of the list, the prev node returned is the new head of the reversed list.

/**

 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null) return null;
        
        return reverse(null, head);
    }

    public ListNode reverse(ListNode prev, ListNode curr){
        if(curr == null) return prev;

        ListNode next = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        
        return reverse(curr, next);
    }
}
```

## Thought 3:
We do it recursively in another way. This Java code implements a recursive method to reverse a singly linked list. The reverseList function defined in the code takes the head node of the list, head, as a parameter. Initially, it checks if the head is null, returning null if so; if the list contains only one node, it returns that node, as a single-node list remains unchanged after reversal.  
For lists with more than one node, the function recursively calls itself, passing the next node of the head, head.next. The recursion continues until the last node is reached. During the recursive return process, the next node's next pointer is set to point to the current node, effectively reversing the connection. At the same time, the current nodeâ€™s next is set to null to disconnect it from the subsequent nodes. Thus, as the recursion reaches the last node, it becomes the new head of the list and gradually reverses the entire list.  
The process dives deep into the list to the last node through recursion and then reverses the links between nodes layer by layer on the way back, eventually returning the new head node, thereby completing the list reversal. This method has a space complexity of O(n) due to the stack space required to maintain the state of the recursive calls.

 * }

class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null) return null;
        else if(head.next == null) return head;

        ListNode next = reverseList(head.next);
        head.next.next = head;
        head.next = null;
        
        return next;
    }
}
