## Question: 

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is n.  
1 <= k <= n <= 5000  
0 <= Node.val <= 1000  

Follow-up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?

## Thought:
First we detect how many nodes are there in the linked list. Then we do the reversion just like Question 92.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {
        if (head == null || k == 1) return head;

        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode prev = dummy, current = head;

        int count = 0;
        while (current != null) {
            count++;
            current = current.next;
        }

        while (count >= k) {
            current = prev.next;
            ListNode next = current.next;

            for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
                current.next = next.next;
                next.next = current;
                prev.next = next;
                next = current.next;
            }

            prev = current;
            count -= k;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
