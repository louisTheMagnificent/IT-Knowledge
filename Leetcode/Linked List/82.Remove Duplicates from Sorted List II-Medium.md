## Question:

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.   

Example 1:  

Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]  
Output: [1,2,5]  
 
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]  
Output: [2,3]  

Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].  
-100 <= Node.val <= 100  
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

## Thought: 
We use dummyNode and fast slow pointers to do it. If head is null, return head directly. Else the slow pointer points at the dummy 
and the fast one points at the head. Also we set a mark to detect whether we find repeats or not, its default value is null. 
We do the loop until head is null. if fast.next is not null and fast.next.val == fast.val, set mark as true and the slow.next = fast, fast move next. 
Do it until fast.next == null or fast.next.val changes. If fast.next is null and repeat is false, break. If fast.next is null and repeat is true, slow.next = null and break.
Else, if repeat is false, slow = fast, fast = fast.next. If repeat is true, fast = fast.next, slow = fast. Then we return dummy.next.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode slow = new ListNode();
        ListNode fast = new ListNode();
        slow = dummy;
        fast = head;
        boolean repeated = false;
        while(fast != null){
            while(fast.next != null && fast.val == fast.next.val){
                repeated = true;
                fast = fast.next;
                slow.next = fast;
            }
            if(fast.next == null){
                if(!repeated) break;
                slow.next = null;
                break;
            }
            else if(fast.next != null && fast.next.val != fast.val){
                if(!repeated){
                    slow = fast;
                    fast = fast.next;
                }
                else{
                    fast = fast.next;
                    slow.next = fast;
                    repeated = false;
                }
            }
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
