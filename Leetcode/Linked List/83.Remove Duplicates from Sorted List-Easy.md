## Question:

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example 1:  

Input: head = [1,1,2]  
Output: [1,2]  

Example 2:  

Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]  
Output: [1,2,3]  

Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].  
-100 <= Node.val <= 100  
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

## Thought:
We use dummyNode and fast slow pointers to do it. If head is null, we return head directly. Else we set dummynode, slow pointer pointing at 
head, fast one pointing at head.next. Do the loop until fast == null. If slow.val == fast.val, fast to the next until the val changes. Then we 
set slow.next = fast, slow move to next and fast move to next. After the loop we set slow.next as null because we have got all the distinct numbers.
Then return dummy.next.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null) return head;
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode();
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode slow = new ListNode(), fast = new ListNode();
        slow = head;
        fast = head.next;

        while(fast != null){
            if(fast.val == slow.val){
                fast = fast.next;
            } 
            else{
                slow.next = fast;
                slow = slow.next;
                fast = fast.next;
            }
        }
        slow.next = null;
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
