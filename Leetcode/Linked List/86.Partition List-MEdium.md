## Question:

Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.  

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.   

Example 1:  

Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3  
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]  

Example 2:  

Input: head = [2,1], x = 2  
Output: [1,2]  
 
Constraints:  

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].  
-100 <= Node.val <= 100  
-200 <= x <= 200

## Thought:
We need two linkes list. One contains the less value nodes and the other one contains the rest nodes. Last, we connect the less list
with the large list.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode largeHead = new ListNode();
        ListNode lessHead = new ListNode();
        ListNode large = largeHead;
        ListNode less = lessHead;

        while(head != null){
            if(head.val < x){
                less.next = head;
                less = less.next;
            }
            else{
                large.next = head;
                large = large.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }

        less.next = largeHead.next;
        large.next = null;
        return lessHead.next;
    }
}
```
