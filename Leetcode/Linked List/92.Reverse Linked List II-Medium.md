## Question:

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.
 
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]  

Example 2:

Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is n.  
1 <= n <= 500  
-500 <= Node.val <= 500  
1 <= left <= right <= n  

Follow up: Could you do it in one pass?

## Thought:
Virtual head node:  
Purpose: The food part is located at the head of the linked list to simplify operations and maintain code consistency.

Operation: Create a virtual head node with a value of 0, and its next pointer points to the actual head node head of the linked list.  
Find the starting position of the workpiece:  
Modification purpose: Find the previous key point of the food segment so that the link can be started from here.

Operation: Use the previous pointer to start from the virtual head node and move forward and left 1 time to locate the previous node of the tree segment.  
Start grilling the specified segment of the linked list:  

Indicator:  
start: The first node of that segment of ingredients.  
Then: The next node of the start node will be moved to the starting position of the stack segment.  
Purpose: By adjusting the pointer, gradually move the pointed node to the previous node to achieve local hotspots.  
Operation:  
In the right-left loop, each time the node is advanced to the position behind the previous one, that is, the front of the current part.  
Adjust start.next to point to the next node of then (that is, the next node currently moved to the front) to prepare for the next iteration.  
Update then.next to prev.next, which is actually equivalent to inserting the then node into the starting position of the tool segment.  
Update prev.next to then to complete the insertion of the then node.  
Then move the cursor to start.next to prepare for the next iteration.  
Return the new head node:  
Operation: Since the actual head node may be changed (especially when the left is 1), use dummy.next to return the head of the linked list to ensure correctness.

## Solution:
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseBetween(ListNode head, int left, int right) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0); 
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode prev = dummy;  
        
        for (int i = 0; i < left - 1; i++) {
            prev = prev.next;  
        }
        
        ListNode start = prev.next;  
        ListNode then = start.next;  

        for (int i = 0; i < right - left; i++) {
            start.next = then.next;
            then.next = prev.next;
            prev.next = then;
            then = start.next;
        }
        return dummy.next;  
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
