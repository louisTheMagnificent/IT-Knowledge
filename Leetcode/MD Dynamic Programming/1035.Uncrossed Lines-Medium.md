## Question:

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2. We write the integers of nums1 and nums2 (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.  

We may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers nums1[i] and nums2[j] such that:  

nums1[i] == nums2[j], and  
the line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.  

Note that a connecting line cannot intersect even at the endpoints (i.e., each number can only belong to one connecting line).  

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums1 = [1,4,2], nums2 = [1,2,4]  
Output: 2  

Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.  
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from nums1[1] = 4 to nums2[2] = 4 will intersect the line from nums1[2]=2 to nums2[1]=2.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums1 = [2,5,1,2,5], nums2 = [10,5,2,1,5,2]  
Output: 3  

Example 3:  

Input: nums1 = [1,3,7,1,7,5], nums2 = [1,9,2,5,1]  
Output: 2  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500  
1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 2000

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to find the maximum number of uncrossed lines (which can be visualized as connections between elements in two arrays nums1 and nums2 that don't intersect) using a dynamic programming approach, which is equivalent to finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the two arrays:

Initialization:  
A 2D array dp is created with dimensions (nums1.length + 1) x (nums2.length + 1), where dp[i][j] will store the maximum number of uncrossed lines between the first i elements of nums1 and the first j elements of nums2.  
dp[0][0], dp[0][j], and dp[i][0] are implicitly initialized to 0 as the base case, indicating that there are no uncrossed lines when one of the arrays is empty.  

Filling the DP Table:  
Nested loops iterate through each element of nums1 and nums2.  
For each pair (i, j), if nums1[i-1] is equal to nums2[j-1], it implies a new line can be formed without crossing previous lines, so dp[i][j] is updated to dp[i-1][j-1] + 1.  
If they do not match, dp[i][j] is updated to the maximum of the values from dp[i][j-1] (excluding the current element from nums2) or dp[i-1][j] (excluding the current element from nums1), ensuring that the maximum number of uncrossed lines up to this pair of indices is carried forward.  

Returning the Result:  
After populating the dp table, dp[nums1.length][nums2.length] contains the maximum number of uncrossed lines that can be drawn between the two arrays, which is returned as the final result.  

This dynamic programming solution efficiently computes the maximum number of connections that can be made between the two arrays without any crossing, with a time complexity ofO(n×m), where n is the length of nums1 and m is the length of nums2. The approach leverages the similarity to the LCS problem to determine the optimal alignment of connections between the two sequences.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxUncrossedLines(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[nums1.length + 1][nums2.length + 1];

        for(int i = 1; i <= nums1.length; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= nums2.length; j++){
                if(nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1]) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                else dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j]);
            }
        }

        return dp[nums1.length][nums2.length];
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.  

This Java code solves the problem of finding the maximum number of uncrossed lines (analogous to the longest common subsequence) between two arrays, nums1 and nums2, using a space-optimized dynamic programming approach:  

Initialization:  
A 1D array dp is used where dp[j] stores the maximum number of uncrossed lines up to the j-th element of nums2 considering the elements processed so far from nums1.  
This approach reduces space complexity by maintaining only a single row that is updated iteratively.  

Dynamic Programming Update:  
The outer loop iterates through each element of nums1.  
The inner loop iterates through each element of nums2 from left to right. However, to prevent overwriting values that are yet to be used, updates are based on the previous value (from the left, in the same row) and the value above (from the previous row, which is stored in a temporary variable prev).  

For each element pair:  
If nums1[i - 1] matches nums2[j - 1], dp[j] is updated to 1 plus the value of the diagonal (prev), which represents extending the subsequence by including this matching pair.  
If they do not match, dp[j] is updated to the maximum of the current value (which might have been updated in a previous iteration of the inner loop) and the value to the left (dp[j - 1]), reflecting the best result excluding the current element from nums1 or nums2.  
prev is updated at the end of each iteration of the inner loop to hold the old value of dp[j] before the update, which serves as the diagonal value for the next iteration.  

Returning the Result:  
The value at dp[nums2.length] by the end of the loops contains the maximum number of uncrossed lines that can be formed between the entire nums1 and nums2.  

This method is particularly efficient in terms of space, using only O(m) space where m is the length of nums2, and O(n×m) in terms of time where n is the length of nums1. This optimization is crucial for handling large input sizes effectively.

            int prev = dp[0];
            for(int j = 1; j <= nums2.length; j++){
                int temp = dp[j];
                if(nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1]) dp[j] = prev + 1;
                else dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j - 1], dp[j]);
