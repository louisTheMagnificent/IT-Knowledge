## Question:

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.  

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:  

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and  
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.  
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.  

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.  

Example 1:  

Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]  
Output: 1  

Explanation:  
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,  
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,  
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,  
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value.  

Example 2:  

Input: stones = [31,26,33,21,40]  
Output: 5  

Constraints:  

1 <= stones.length <= 30  
1 <= stones[i] <= 100

## Thought:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements the lastStoneWeightII method within the Solution class, which solves the problem of minimizing the difference in weights by smashing pairs of stones from an array. The method is based on a dynamic programming approach that is similar to the subset-sum problem.  

The code starts by calculating the total sum of all stones. The target value is set to half the total sum, rounded up if the sum is odd, aiming to find two subsets of stones whose sum difference is minimal.  

It uses a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] stores the maximum weight that can be achieved with the first i+1 stones without exceeding weight j. Initialization is done for the first stone, setting dp[0][j] to the weight of the first stone if it doesn't exceed the target.  

For each subsequent stone, the method iterates through possible total weights from 0 up to the target:  

If the current stone's weight exceeds j, it just carries over the value from the previous stone.  
Otherwise, it updates the dp value to the maximum of either not taking the current stone or taking it, which adds the current stone's weight to the optimal value achievable with the remaining weight.  
Special checks are made to immediately return 0 or 1 if a perfect balance is achievable (i.e., if dp[i][target] equals the target and matches the parity of the total sum).  

Finally, if no perfect balance is found, the function calculates and returns the minimal difference by comparing twice the value found in the last cell of the DP array to the total sum, using their absolute difference to represent the smallest possible difference in weight after all stones are considered.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeightII(int[] stones) {
        if(stones.length == 1) return stones[0];

        int sum = 0;
        for(int num: stones){
            sum += num;
        }

        int target = sum / 2;
        if(sum % 2 == 1) target++;

        if(stones[0] == target && sum % 2 == 0) return 0;
        else if(stones[0] == target && sum % 2 == 1) return 1;

        int[][] dp = new int[stones.length][target + 1];
        for(int j = stones[0]; j <= target; j++){
            dp[0][j] = stones[0];
        }

        for(int i = 1; i < stones.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j <= target; j++){
                if(j < stones[i]){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                }
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - stones[i]] + stones[i]);
                }
            }
            if(dp[i][target] == target && sum % 2 == 0) return 0;
            else if(dp[i][target] == target && sum % 2 == 1) return 1;
        }

        return Math.abs(dp[stones.length - 1][target] * 2 - sum);
        
    }
}
```
