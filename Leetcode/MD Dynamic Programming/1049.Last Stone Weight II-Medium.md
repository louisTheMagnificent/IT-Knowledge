## Question:

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.  

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:  

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and  
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.  
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.  

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.  

Example 1:  

Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]  
Output: 1  

Explanation:  
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,  
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,  
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,  
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value.  

Example 2:  

Input: stones = [31,26,33,21,40]  
Output: 5  

Constraints:  

1 <= stones.length <= 30  
1 <= stones[i] <= 100

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements the lastStoneWeightII method within the Solution class, which solves the problem of minimizing the difference in weights by smashing pairs of stones from an array. The method is based on a dynamic programming approach that is similar to the subset-sum problem.  

The code starts by calculating the total sum of all stones. The target value is set to half the total sum, rounded up if the sum is odd, aiming to find two subsets of stones whose sum difference is minimal.  

It uses a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] stores the maximum weight that can be achieved with the first i+1 stones without exceeding weight j. Initialization is done for the first stone, setting dp[0][j] to the weight of the first stone if it doesn't exceed the target.  

For each subsequent stone, the method iterates through possible total weights from 0 up to the target:  

If the current stone's weight exceeds j, it just carries over the value from the previous stone.  
Otherwise, it updates the dp value to the maximum of either not taking the current stone or taking it, which adds the current stone's weight to the optimal value achievable with the remaining weight.  
Special checks are made to immediately return 0 or 1 if a perfect balance is achievable (i.e., if dp[i][target] equals the target and matches the parity of the total sum).  

Finally, if no perfect balance is found, the function calculates and returns the minimal difference by comparing twice the value found in the last cell of the DP array to the total sum, using their absolute difference to represent the smallest possible difference in weight after all stones are considered.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeightII(int[] stones) {
        if(stones.length == 1) return stones[0];

        int sum = 0;
        for(int num: stones){
            sum += num;
        }

        int target = sum / 2;
        if(sum % 2 == 1) target++;

        if(stones[0] == target && sum % 2 == 0) return 0;
        else if(stones[0] == target && sum % 2 == 1) return 1;

        int[][] dp = new int[stones.length][target + 1];
        for(int j = stones[0]; j <= target; j++){
            dp[0][j] = stones[0];
        }

        for(int i = 1; i < stones.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j <= target; j++){
                if(j < stones[i]){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                }
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - stones[i]] + stones[i]);
                }
            }
            if(dp[i][target] == target && sum % 2 == 0) return 0;
            else if(dp[i][target] == target && sum % 2 == 1) return 1;
        }

        return Math.abs(dp[stones.length - 1][target] * 2 - sum);
        
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use MD DP to do it but only 1d array.

This Java method lastStoneWeightII calculates the minimum possible weight difference between two groups formed by smashing stones together, based on a problem variant similar to partitioning an array into two subsets such that the difference in their sums is minimized.  

Hereâ€™s the approach:  

Base Case: If the array contains only one stone, the method directly returns its weight.  

Sum Calculation: The method computes the total sum of all the stones.  

Target Calculation: It computes a target value as half of the total sum. This is done because the closest we can get to two equal sum subsets, the smaller the difference will be after smashing.  

Dynamic Programming Array Initialization: Initializes a DP array where dp[j] represents the maximum sum of stones that can be achieved with a total weight not exceeding j.  

DP Array Population: Iteratively updates the DP array by including each stone and checking combinations to find the maximum weight close to the target.  

Final Calculation: After populating the DP array, it calculates the minimum difference as sum - 2 * dp[target], which represents twice the difference between one subset and the target, effectively the smallest possible weight difference after all possible smashes.  

The method uses a dynamic programming approach similar to the knapsack problem to find the subset of stones that gets closest to half of the total sum, thus minimizing the final difference between the sums of two subsets formed from the stones.

        for(int num: stones){
            sum += num;
        }

        int target = sum / 2;

        int[] dp = new int[target + 1];

        for(int i = 0; i < stones.length; i++){
            for(int j = target; j >= stones[i]; j--){
                dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], dp[j - stones[i]] + stones[i]);
            }
        }

        return sum - 2 * dp[target];
    }
