## Question:

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.  

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.  

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".  
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.  

Example 1:  

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"   
Output: 3    

Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.  

Example 2:  

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"  
Output: 3  

Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.  

Example 3:  

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"  
Output: 0  

Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 
Constraints:  

1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000  
text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings text1 and text2 using dynamic programming:  

Initialization:  
A 2D array dp is initialized with dimensions (text1.length() + 1) x (text2.length() + 1). Each cell dp[i][j] will store the length of the LCS of the substrings text1[0..i-1] and text2[0..j-1].  

Filling the DP Table:  
Nested loops iterate through each character of text1 and text2.  
For each pair of indices i and j:  
If the characters text1.charAt(i - 1) and text2.charAt(j - 1) match, it indicates that these characters can be part of the LCS. Thus, dp[i][j] is updated to dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1, extending the sequence found up to the previous characters.  
If the characters do not match, dp[i][j] is set to the maximum of either excluding the current character of text1 (dp[i - 1][j]) or text2 (dp[i][j - 1]), reflecting the longest sequence possible without one of these characters.  

Returning the Result:  
The value in dp[text1.length()][text2.length()] provides the length of the LCS of text1 and text2, which is returned as the result.  

This approach systematically constructs the solution using previous computations, effectively building up the LCS length in a bottom-up manner. The time complexity is O(n×m), where n and m are the lengths of text1 and text2, respectively, and the space complexity is also O(n×m) due to the size of the DP table.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[text1.length() + 1][text2.length() + 1];
        for(int i = 1; i <= text1.length(); i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= text2.length(); j++){
                if(text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                else dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[text1.length()][text2.length()];
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code implements a space-optimized dynamic programming solution to find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings, text1 and text2:  

Initialization:  
A 1D array dp is initialized with a length of text2.length() + 1. This array will store the LCS lengths relative to the current and previous row in a conceptual 2D array used in traditional LCS solutions.  
dp[0] is implicitly initialized to 0, reflecting the LCS length with an empty substring.  

Dynamic Programming Calculation:  
An outer loop iterates over each character of text1 from the first to the last character.  
An inner loop iterates over each character of text2, also from the first to the last character.  
For each pair of characters from text1 and text2:  
A temporary variable prev is used to store the value of dp[j-1] from the previous iteration, which simulates the diagonal move (top-left cell in a traditional 2D approach) needed to handle character matches.  
If the current characters (text1.charAt(i - 1) and text2.charAt(j - 1)) match, dp[j] is updated to prev + 1 (where prev is the value of dp[j-1] from the previous row before the update).  
If the characters do not match, dp[j] is updated to the maximum of dp[j] (same column, previous row, simulating skipping the current character in text1) or dp[j-1] (same row, left column, simulating skipping the current character in text2).  
The prev variable is updated at the end of each inner loop iteration to store the old value of dp[j] before it gets overwritten, which is used in the diagonal calculation for matches.  

Returning the Result:  
After all iterations, dp[text2.length()] contains the length of the LCS for the entire strings text1 and text2, which is returned as the result.  

This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n×m) where n is the length of text1 and m is the length of text2, and it reduces the space complexity to O(m) by using only a single array instead of a full 2D table. This optimization is particularly useful in scenarios where memory is a constraint.

        int[] dp = new int[text2.length() + 1];

            int prev = dp[0];
            for(int j = 1; j <= text2.length(); j++){
                int temp = dp[j];
                if(text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)){
                    dp[j] = prev + 1;
                }
                else{
                    dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j - 1], temp);
                }
                prev = temp;
            }
        }

        return dp[text2.length()];
    }
}
