## Question: 

Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.  

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"  
Output: 3  

Explanation:  
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from s.  
rabbbit  
rabbbit  
rabbbit  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"  
Output: 5  

Explanation:  
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from s.  
babgbag  
babgbag  
babgbag  
babgbag  
babgbag  

Constraints:  

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000  
s and t consist of English letters.

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code calculates the number of distinct subsequences of string s that match string t using a dynamic programming approach. It initializes a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of distinct subsequences of the first i characters of s that match the first j characters of t.  
The base cases are set as follows: dp[i][0] is 1 for all i, since an empty t is a subsequence of any prefix of s, and dp[0][j] is 0 for all j>0, since a non-empty t cannot be a subsequence of an empty s.  
For each pair of indices (i, j), if the characters s.charAt(i-1) and t.charAt(j-1) match, dp[i][j] is updated to the sum of dp[i-1][j-1] (the count of subsequences ending just before the current characters) and dp[i-1][j] (the count of subsequences that exclude the current character of s). If the characters do not match, dp[i][j] inherits the value from dp[i-1][j].  
The final value dp[s.length()][t.length()] gives the total count of distinct subsequences of s that match t.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int numDistinct(String s, String t) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s.length() + 1][t.length() + 1];
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) dp[i][0] = 1;
        for(int j = 1; j <= t.length(); j++) dp[0][j] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= t.length(); j++){
                if(s.charAt(i - 1) == t.charAt(j - 1)) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j];
                else dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
            }
        }
        return dp[s.length()][t.length()];
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code efficiently calculates the number of distinct subsequences of string s that match string t using a space-optimized dynamic programming approach. Instead of a 2D array, it utilizes a 1D array dp where dp[j] stores the number of ways to form the first j characters of t using the first i characters of s.  
The code initializes dp[0] to 1, acknowledging that an empty t is a subsequence of any prefix of s, including the empty prefix. The outer loop iterates through each character of s, and the inner loop iterates backwards through t to prevent overwriting results from the previous step that are still needed for computation.  
For each character match (s.charAt(i - 1) == t.charAt(j - 1)), the code updates dp[j] by adding the number of ways to form the subsequence ending right before the current characters (dp[j - 1]). This addition accounts for all the ways t's prefix can be formed by including or excluding the current character of s.  
By the end of the process, dp[t.length()] contains the total count of distinct subsequences of s that match t.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int numDistinct(String s, String t) {
        int[] dp = new int[t.length() + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++){
            int prev = dp[0];
            for(int j = 1; j <= t.length(); j++){
                int temp = dp[j];
                if(s.charAt(i - 1) == t.charAt(j - 1)) dp[j] = prev + dp[j];
                prev = temp;
            }
        }
        return dp[t.length()];
    }
}
```
