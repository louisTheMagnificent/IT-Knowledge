## Question:

Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.  

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.  

Example 1:  

Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]  
Output: 11  

Explanation: The triangle looks like:  
   2  
  3 4  
 6 5 7  
4 1 8 3  
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).  

Example 2:  

Input: triangle = [[-10]]  
Output: -10  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= triangle.length <= 200  
triangle[0].length == 1  
triangle[i].length == triangle[i - 1].length + 1  
-104 <= triangle[i][j] <= 104  
 
Follow up: Could you do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle?

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of a triangle represented as a list of lists. Here's a concise overview of its design:  

Initialization of DP Table: A 2D array dp is initialized, where dp[i][j] holds the minimum path sum to reach element (i, j) in the triangle. The top element of the triangle (dp[0][0]) is initialized with the first element of the triangle.  

Filling the DP Table: The solution iterates through each level of the triangle starting from the second row. For each element (i, j) in the triangle:  
If the element is the first in its row (j == 0), it can only be reached from the element directly above it (dp[i-1][j]).  
If the element is the last in its row (j == i), it can only be reached from the element directly above and to the left (dp[i-1][j-1]).  
For all other elements, the minimum path sum can be calculated by adding the current element's value to the minimum of the sums from the two possible elements above it (dp[i-1][j-1] and dp[i-1][j]).  
Finding the Minimum Path Sum at the Bottom: Once the dp table is filled, the code scans the last row of the dp array to find the minimum path sum that reaches the bottom of the triangle.  

Result: The minimum value found in the last row of the dp table is returned as the result, representing the minimum total from top to bottom of the triangle.  

This approach ensures that all potential paths are considered by building up solutions from the top of the triangle downwards, thereby efficiently finding the path with the minimum sum.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int minimumTotal(List<List<Integer>> triangle) {
        int[][] dp = new int[triangle.size()][triangle.size()];
        dp[0][0] = triangle.get(0).get(0);
        for(int i = 1; i < triangle.size(); i++){
            List<Integer> list = triangle.get(i);
            for(int j = 0; j <= i; j++){
                int curr = list.get(j);
                if(j == 0){
                    dp[i][j] = curr + dp[i - 1][j];
                }
                else if(j == i){
                    dp[i][j] = curr + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                }
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = curr + Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int j = 0; j < triangle.size(); j++){
            if(result > dp[triangle.size() - 1][j]) result = dp[triangle.size() - 1][j];
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code provides an optimized dynamic programming solution to find the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of a triangle, represented as a list of lists. The approach utilizes a space-efficient 1D array dp to store the minimum path sums. Here’s a concise explanation of its design:  

Initialization: The first element of the dp array is initialized with the triangle's top value (dp[0] = triangle.get(0).get(0)).  

Updating dp Array: The solution iterates through each level of the triangle starting from the second row. For each element (i, j):  
If the element is the first in its row (j == 0), it can only be reached from the element directly above it, and dp[j] is updated by adding the current element’s value.  
If the element is not the last (j < i), the minimum path sum is computed by considering both the element directly above (dp[j]) and the element above-left (dp[j - 1]). The current element’s value is added to the smaller of these two sums.  
If the element is the last in its row (j == i), it can only be reached from the element directly above-left, and dp[j] is updated accordingly.  
Extracting the Minimum Path Sum: After processing all rows, the code scans through the dp array to find the minimum value, which represents the smallest path sum to reach the bottom of the triangle.  

Result: The minimum value found in the dp array is returned as the solution.  

This method is efficient as it requires only a single array to store the minimum path sums and updates it in place, reducing the space complexity compared to using a 2D array. The solution iteratively updates each possible path to the bottom, ensuring the minimum sum is correctly calculated.

        dp[0] = triangle.get(0).get(0);
        for(int i = 1; i < triangle.size(); i++){
            List<Integer> list = triangle.get(i);
            for(int j = i; j >= 0; j--){
                int curr = list.get(j);
                if(j == 0){
                    dp[j] = curr + dp[j];
