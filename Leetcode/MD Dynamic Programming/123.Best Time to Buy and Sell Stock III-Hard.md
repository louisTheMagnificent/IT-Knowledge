## Question: 
 
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.  

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.  

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).  

Example 1:  

Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]  
Output: 6  

Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.  
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.  

Example 2:  

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]  
Output: 4  

Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.  
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.  

Example 3:  

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]  
Output: 0  

Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.  

Constraints:  

1 <= prices.length <= 105  
0 <= prices[i] <= 105

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III" problem using dynamic programming. The problem allows up to two transactions to maximize the profit given a list of daily stock prices. The design involves maintaining a state machine with five states to track the transitions between buying and selling actions:  

Initialization of DP Array:  
A 2D array dp is initialized where dp[i][j] represents the maximum profit on day i with the state j.  

Five states are tracked:  
dp[i][0]: No transactions have been done.  
dp[i][1]: After buying the stock for the first time.  
dp[i][2]: After selling the stock for the first time.  
dp[i][3]: After buying the stock for the second time.  
dp[i][4]: After selling the stock for the second time.  

Initial conditions set dp[0][1] and dp[0][3] to -prices[0] to represent buying stocks on the first day, and other initial profits are set to 0 or appropriate values based on the possible transactions by that state.  

Dynamic Programming Transition:  
Iterate through the stock prices from the second day onward.  
For each day and each state, update the dp array to reflect the maximum profit achievable, considering the previous state and the current price:  
dp[i][0]: No stock transactions, carry forward the value.  
dp[i][1]: Maximum of staying in the same state or buying the stock today (which requires being in state 0 previously).  
dp[i][2]: Maximum of staying in the same state or selling the stock today (transition from state 1).  
dp[i][3]: Maximum of staying in the same state or buying the stock again today (transition from state 2).  
dp[i][4]: Maximum of staying in the same state or selling the stock the second time (transition from state 3).  

Returning the Result:  
The function returns dp[prices.length - 1][4], representing the maximum profit possible by the end of the last day after potentially completing two transactions.  

This approach optimally tracks the sequence of buying and selling decisions to ensure the highest possible profit under the rule that no two buys can occur consecutively without an intervening sell, and it handles up to two such transaction cycles.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][5];
        dp[0][1] = -prices[0];
        dp[0][3] = -prices[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0];
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] - prices[i]);
            dp[i][2] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][2], dp[i - 1][1] + prices[i]);
            dp[i][3] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][3], dp[i - 1][2] - prices[i]);
            dp[i][4] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][4], dp[i - 1][3] + prices[i]);
        }

        return dp[prices.length - 1][4];
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code offers a solution to the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III" problem, which allows for up to two transactions to maximize the profit from an array of daily stock prices. The solution employs a dynamic programming approach with space optimization:  

Initialization of DP Array:  
A 1D array dp with four elements is initialized to keep track of profits across different stages of buying and selling:  
dp[0]: Maximum profit after the first buy.  
dp[1]: Maximum profit after the first sell.  
dp[2]: Maximum profit after the second buy.  
dp[3]: Maximum profit after the second sell.  
dp[0] and dp[2] are initialized to -prices[0] since the only action on the first day can be buying the stock, thus reflecting a loss equal to the stock's price.  

Dynamic Profit Calculation:  
The algorithm iterates through the list of prices, updating each state in the dp array:  
dp[0]: Updated to reflect the maximum of the existing value or the negative of the current price, representing the decision to buy the stock if not already done or to maintain the prior buy.  
dp[1]: Updated to reflect the maximum of the existing value or the profit obtained by adding the current price to dp[0], representing the profit from selling the stock.  
dp[2]: Updated to reflect the maximum of the existing value or the value obtained by subtracting the current price from dp[1], representing buying the stock a second time after selling it once.  
dp[3]: Updated to reflect the maximum of the existing value or the profit obtained by adding the current price to dp[2], representing the profit from selling the stock a second time.  

Returning the Result:  
The function returns dp[3], which holds the maximum profit achievable after possibly completing two buy-sell transactions.  

This approach effectively manages the constraints of the problem—two transactions maximum with the requirement to sell before buying again—using constant space and linear time relative to the number of days.

```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int[] dp = new int[4];
        dp[0] = -prices[0];
        dp[2] = -prices[0];
        for(int i = 1; i <= prices.length; i++){
            dp[0] = Math.max(dp[0], - prices[i - 1]);
            dp[1] = Math.max(dp[1], dp[0] + prices[i - 1]);
            dp[2] = Math.max(dp[2], dp[1] - prices[i - 1]);
            dp[3] = Math.max(dp[3], dp[2] + prices[i - 1]);
        }
        return dp[3];
    }
}
