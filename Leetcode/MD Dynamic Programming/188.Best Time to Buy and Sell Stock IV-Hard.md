## Question:

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.  

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions: i.e. you may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.  

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).  

Example 1:  

Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]  
Output: 2  

Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.  

Example 2:  

Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]  
Output: 7  

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= k <= 100   
1 <= prices.length <= 1000  
0 <= prices[i] <= 1000

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements a dynamic programming solution to the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV" problem, where the objective is to maximize profit from up to k buy-sell transactions given a list of daily stock prices:  

Initialization of DP Array:  
A 2D array dp is created where dp[i][j] represents the maximum profit on day i with j transaction actions (buy or sell) completed.  
For each initial buying action (every even index up to 2k), dp[0][i] is initialized to -prices[0] to represent buying the stock on the first day.  

Filling the DP Table:  

The process iterates through each day's prices starting from the second day (i = 1 to prices.length - 1):  

For the first transaction pair (buy and sell):  

dp[i][0]: Updated to the maximum of staying in the buy state from the previous day or buying the stock today (which implies no prior transactions).  
dp[i][1]: Updated to the maximum of staying in the sell state from the previous day or selling the stock today.  

For subsequent transaction pairs:  
Buying states (dp[i][j] for even j): Updated to the maximum of staying in the buy state or buying the stock today after the previous transaction was a sell.  
Selling states (dp[i][j + 1] for even j): Updated to the maximum of staying in the sell state or selling the stock today.  

Returning the Result:  
The function returns dp[prices.length - 1][2 * k - 1], which contains the maximum profit possible by the last day after completing up to k transactions.  
This approach systematically tracks the profit for each possible transaction state for every day, ensuring that the result reflects the best possible trading strategy given the constraint of k transactions. This methodology effectively handles multiple trading cycles, capturing the complexities of buying and selling decisions over multiple days.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][k * 2];
        for(int i = 0; i < 2 * k; i += 2){
            dp[0][i] = -prices[0];
        }

        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], -prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i]);
            for(int j = 2; j < 2 * k; j += 2){
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] - prices[i]);
                dp[i][j + 1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j + 1], dp[i - 1][j] + prices[i]);
            }
        }

        return dp[prices.length - 1][2 * k - 1];
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code implements a space-optimized dynamic programming approach to solve the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV" problem, where the goal is to maximize profit with up to k transactions given daily stock prices:  

Initialization of DP Array:  
A 1D array dp of size 2 * k is initialized to track the maximum profit at each stage of buying and selling up to k transactions.  
Each even index in dp, which represents a buy state for each transaction cycle, is initialized to -prices[0], indicating that the stock was bought on the first day.  

Iterative Profit Calculation:  
Iterates over the array of prices from the second day onwards.  
Updates the dp array for each price, processing all transaction states:  
For the first transaction (initial buy and sell):  
dp[0]: Updated to reflect the maximum of the existing buy state or buying the stock on that day.    
dp[1]: Updated to reflect the maximum of the existing sell state or selling the stock on that day.   
For each subsequent transaction cycle (up to k):  
Buying states (dp[j] for each even j): Updated to the maximum of maintaining the buy state or buying the stock on that day after completing the previous sell.  
Selling states (dp[j + 1] for each even j): Updated to the maximum of maintaining the sell state or selling the stock on that day.   

Returning the Result:  
Returns dp[2 * k - 1], which holds the maximum profit achievable after completing up to k transactions.  

This approach uses only a single array (dp) to keep track of the profits across multiple transactions, thereby saving space while ensuring that each potential buy or sell operation is considered optimally for maximizing profit. This method efficiently updates the profit states for each day in linear time relative to the number of days and transactions.

    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        int[] dp = new int[k * 2];
        for(int i = 0; i < 2 * k; i += 2){
            dp[i] = -prices[0];
        }

        for(int i = 1; i <= prices.length; i++){
            dp[0] = Math.max(dp[0], -prices[i - 1]);
            dp[1] = Math.max(dp[1], dp[0] + prices[i - 1]);
            for(int j = 2; j < 2 * k; j += 2){
                dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], dp[j - 1] - prices[i - 1]);
                dp[j + 1] = Math.max(dp[j + 1], dp[j] + prices[i - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[2 * k - 1];
    }
}
```
