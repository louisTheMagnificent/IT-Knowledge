## Question:

Example 1:  

Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]  
Output: 4  

Example 2:

Example 3:  

Input: matrix = [["0"]]  
Output: 0  
 
Constraints:  

m == matrix.length  
n == matrix[i].length  
1 <= m, n <= 300  
matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the area of the largest square containing only 1s in a given binary matrix. The approach involves the following steps:  

Initialization:  
A 2D array dp is initialized where dp[i][j] represents the size of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at (i, j).  
The first row and the first column of the dp array are initialized by directly checking if each cell in the matrix is 1. If it is, dp[i][0] or dp[0][j] is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. This initialization also updates a variable result if any of these cells are 1, marking the presence of at least a single-cell square.  

Filling the DP Table:  
For each cell (i, j) in the matrix starting from the second row and second column, if the value of the matrix at that cell is 1, the cell's dp value is computed as the minimum of the three neighboring cells to the top, left, and top-left (dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) plus one. This operation effectively builds the largest possible square ending at that cell by extending the smallest square possible from its neighbors.  
Update the result each time if the computed dp value is larger than the current result.  

Result Calculation:  
The maximum value found in dp (stored in result) represents the side length of the largest square found in the matrix. The area of the square is then computed by squaring result.  

This method systematically checks each cell to determine if it can be the bottom-right corner of a square and dynamically updates the possible largest square size using previously computed values, ensuring an efficient calculation of the largest possible square's area.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maximalSquare(char[][] matrix) {
        int[][] dp = new int[matrix.length][matrix[0].length];
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++){
            dp[i][0] = matrix[i][0] == '1' ? 1 : 0;
            if(dp[i][0] > result) result = dp[i][0];
        }
        for(int j = 1; j < matrix[0].length; j++){
            dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j] == '1' ? 1 : 0;
            if(dp[0][j] > result) result = dp[0][j];
        }

        for(int i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j < matrix[0].length; j++){
                if(matrix[i][j] == '1'){
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])) + 1;
                    if(dp[i][j] > result) result = dp[i][j];
                }
            }
        }

        return result * result;
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code uses a space-optimized dynamic programming approach to find the largest square containing only 1s in a binary matrix. The solution involves the following key steps:  

Space Optimization:  
Instead of using a 2D array, the solution uses a 1D array dp where each dp[j] holds the size of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at the current row i and column j.  

Initial Setup:  
Initialize the dp array using the first row of the matrix, setting dp[j] to 1 if matrix[0][j] is 1 and to 0 otherwise. Track the maximum square size found in the first row using the variable result.  

Dynamic Programming Update:  
Iterate over each row starting from the second row. For each cell (i, j):  
Save the current value of dp[j] in prev for use in the next iteration.  
If matrix[i][j] is 1, update dp[j] using the minimum of three possible values: dp[j] (above), dp[j-1] (left), and prev (top-left diagonal from the previous row), plus one. This represents forming a larger square by adding matrix[i][j] to the square formed at the previous row.  
If matrix[i][j] is 0, set dp[j] to 0.  
Update the result if the new dp[j] is greater than the current maximum.  
Update dp[0] for the first column in each row similarly.  

Compute Final Result:  
Square the maximum side length (result) to get the area of the largest square found.  

This method is efficient in terms of space as it requires only a single array (dp) and iteratively updates it, ensuring that the minimum space is used while maintaining the ability to calculate the maximum square size. The logic ensures all elements are properly considered by updating values based on the possibility of forming a square at each matrix cell.

            dp[j] = matrix[0][j] == '1' ? 1 : 0;
            if(dp[j] > result) result = dp[j];
        }

        for(int i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++){
            int prev = dp[0];
            dp[0] = matrix[i][0] == '1' ? 1 : 0;

                }
                else dp[j] = 0;
                prev = temp;
            }
        }

        return result * result;
