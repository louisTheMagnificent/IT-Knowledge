## Question:

Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n.  

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.  

Example 1:  

Input: n = 12  
Output: 3  

Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 13  
Output: 2  

Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.  

Constraints:  

1 <= n <= 104

## Thought: 
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java method numSquares calculates the minimum number of perfect square numbers that sum up to a given integer n using a dynamic programming approach:  

Initialization:  
A DP array dp of size n+1 is initialized where dp[j] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to j.  
dp is filled with a large value (Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2) to represent initially unreachable sums.  
dp[0] is set to 0 because no squares are needed to sum to zero.  

Dynamic Programming Fill:  
The outer loop iterates through all integers i such that i*i is less than or equal to n, considering all squares starting from 0.  
The inner loop iterates from i*i to n, updating dp[j] for each sum j that can be reached by adding the square i*i to a previous sum.  
The DP update formula dp[j] = Math.min(dp[j], dp[j - i * i] + 1) ensures that dp[j] records the minimum count of squares needed to reach the sum j.  

Result:  
The method returns dp[n], which contains the minimum number of perfect square numbers that sum up to n.  

This approach efficiently calculates the minimum number of squares needed for each number from 1 to n by iteratively considering each square's contribution to possible sums.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {
    public int numSquares(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];

        Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2);

        dp[0] = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i * i <= n; i++){
            for(int j = i * i; j <= n; j++){
                dp[j] = Math.min(dp[j], dp[j - i * i] + 1);
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
