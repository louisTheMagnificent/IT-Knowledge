## Question:

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.  

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:  

After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).  
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:  

Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]  
Output: 3  

Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]  

Example 2:  

Input: prices = [1]  
Output: 0  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= prices.length <= 5000  
0 <= prices[i] <= 1000

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements a dynamic programming solution for a stock trading problem where the goal is to maximize profit with up to two transactions under certain trading restrictions. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the code's design:  

Initialization:  
A 2D array dp is used, where dp[i][j] represents the profit on the i-th day for different states:  
dp[i][0]: Maximum profit when holding a stock after a buy.  
dp[i][1]: Maximum profit when not holding a stock and not in cooldown.  
dp[i][2]: Maximum profit immediately after selling a stock.  
dp[i][3]: Maximum profit while in a cooldown period after selling.  
Initial values are set for the first day, dp[0][0] is initialized to -prices[0] indicating the cost of buying stock on the first day.  

DP Array Population:  
For each subsequent day, update the DP table:  
dp[i][0]: Updated to the maximum of retaining the stock or buying a new stock either after selling on a previous day (dp[i-1][3]) or after a cooldown (dp[i-1][1]).  
dp[i][1]: Maximum of retaining the no-stock state or transitioning to no-stock after a cooldown.  
dp[i][2]: Represents the profit from selling the stock held from the previous day.  
dp[i][3]: Set to the profit value from the previous day after selling (dp[i-1][2]), indicating entering cooldown.  

Compute the Final Profit:  
The solution considers the maximum profit possible on the last day from either being in a no-stock state (dp[n-1][1]), right after selling a stock (dp[n-1][2]), or being in a cooldown (dp[n-1][3]).  

This approach enables tracking of profits across different trading states and optimizes for the highest profit possible under the constraints of a maximum of two transactions, each followed by a mandatory cooldown.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][4];
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], Math.max(dp[i - 1][3] - prices[i], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]));
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][3]);
            dp[i][2] = dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i];
            dp[i][3] = dp[i - 1][2];
        }

        return Math.max(dp[prices.length - 1][1], Math.max(dp[prices.length - 1][2], dp[prices.length - 1][3]));
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code implements a space-optimized dynamic programming solution for a stock trading problem, allowing for multiple buy and sell transactions with a cooldown period. The aim is to maximize profit given a list of daily stock prices:  

Initialization:  
A 1D array dp of size 4 is used to keep track of different states of stock transactions:  
dp[0]: Maximum profit after buying a stock or holding the bought stock.  
dp[1]: Maximum profit when no stock is held and not in a cooldown period.  
dp[2]: Maximum profit after selling a stock.  
dp[3]: Maximum profit while in a cooldown period after selling a stock.  
Initially, dp[0] is set to -prices[0], indicating the cost of buying stock on the first day.  

Dynamic Programming Transition:  
For each day (from the second day onward), the array dp is updated using temporary variables to handle the transitions:  
Update dp[0] to the maximum of the existing value (holding the stock), buying a new stock after a cooldown (dp[3]), or buying after not holding any stock (dp[1]).  
Update dp[1] to the maximum of staying in the no-stock state or transitioning into no-stock state from a cooldown (dp[3]).  
Update dp[2] to reflect the profit from selling a stock held previously.  
dp[3] is updated to the value of dp[2] from the previous day, reflecting the entry into cooldown.  

Compute the Final Profit:  
After iterating through all days, the function returns the maximum value among dp[1] (no stock, no cooldown), dp[2] (just sold the stock), and dp[3] (in cooldown), representing the highest achievable profit.  

This method effectively uses dynamic programming to optimize profit calculation by transitioning between buying, selling, and cooldown states, with constant space complexity relative to the number of transactions allowed.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int[] dp = new int[4];
        dp[0] = -prices[0];
        for(int i = 1; i <= prices.length; i++){
            int temp1 = dp[0];
            int temp2 = dp[2];
            dp[0] = Math.max(dp[0], Math.max(dp[3] - prices[i - 1], dp[1] - prices[i - 1]));
            dp[1] = Math.max(dp[1], dp[3]);
            dp[2] = temp1 + prices[i - 1];
            dp[3] = temp2;
        }

        return Math.max(dp[1], Math.max(dp[2], dp[3]));
    }
}
```
