## Question:

Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.  

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4  
Output: 7  

Explanation:  
The possible combination ways are:  
(1, 1, 1, 1)  
(1, 1, 2)  
(1, 2, 1)  
(1, 3)  
(2, 1, 1)  
(2, 2)  
(3, 1)  

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [9], target = 3  
Output: 0  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 200  
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000  
All the elements of nums are unique.  
1 <= target <= 1000  
 
Follow up: What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This code solves the problem of finding the number of possible combinations that add up to a target using elements from the array nums. It uses dynamic programming with a dp array, where dp[j] represents the number of ways to reach the sum j. Starting with dp[0] = 1 (base case), it iterates over each possible sum (j) and checks each number in nums, updating dp[j] by adding the combinations that include nums[i]. Finally, it returns dp[target] as the result.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
        
        dp[0] = 1;

        for(int j = 0; j <= target; j++){
            for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
                if(j >= nums[i]) dp[j] += dp[j - nums[i]];
            }
        }

        return dp[target];
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it.

This code uses a 2D dynamic programming approach where dp[i][j] represents the number of combinations to achieve the sum j using the first i+1 numbers from the array. It initializes dp[i][0] to 1, as a sum of 0 can be achieved with no numbers. For each target sum j and each number nums[i], it updates dp[i][j] based on whether nums[i] is included or excluded, handling edge cases for the first row and column separately. Finally, it returns dp[nums.length - 1][target] as the result.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int combinationSum4(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[][] dp = new int[nums.length][target + 1];

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }

        for(int j = 1; j <= target; j++){
            for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
                if(j < nums[i]){
                    if(i == 0) dp[i][j] = 0;
                    else dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                }
                else{
                    if(i == 0){
                        dp[i][j] = dp[nums.length - 1][j - nums[i]];
                    }
                    else{
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[nums.length - 1][j - nums[i]];
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[nums.length - 1][target];
    }
}
```
