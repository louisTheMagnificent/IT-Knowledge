## Question:

Given an integer array nums, return true if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or false otherwise.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]  
Output: true  

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]  
Output: false  

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 200  
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

## Thought 1: 
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code defines a method canPartition in the Solution class to determine if an array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sums of the elements in both subsets are equal. The method uses dynamic programming to approach this problem.  

The code starts by checking the basic conditions: if the array has only one element, it cannot be partitioned, so it returns false. Then, it calculates the total sum of the array. If the sum is odd, it cannot be evenly split into two equal parts, and hence returns false.  

The main computation begins by setting the target sum as half of the total sum. A 2D array dp is used where dp[i][j] stores the maximum sum achievable with the first i items that does not exceed j. The first row of the DP table is initialized with the value of the first element of the array for sums that are at least as large as this element.  

For each subsequent element in the array, the method fills the DP table row by row. If the current subset sum j is less than the current item nums[i], the DP value is carried over from the previous item. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum of not taking or taking the current item.  

The algorithm returns true as soon as any row in the DP table has a subset sum that matches half of the total array sum, indicating a valid partition is possible. If no such partition is found by the end of the loop, it returns false.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPartition(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 1) return false;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int num : nums){
            sum += num;
        }

        if(sum % 2 == 1) return false;

        sum /= 2;

        int[][] dp = new int[nums.length][sum + 1];

        for(int j = nums[0]; j <= sum; j++){
            dp[0][j] = nums[0];
        }
        if(dp[0][sum] == sum) return true;

        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j <= sum; j++){
                if(j < nums[i]){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                }
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - nums[i]] + nums[i]);
                }
            }
            if(dp[i][sum] == sum) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements a method canPartition within the Solution class to determine if an array can be divided into two subsets with equal sums. The approach leverages dynamic programming.  

The code begins by handling edge cases, such as arrays with only one element (which cannot be partitioned) and arrays whose sum is odd (which cannot be evenly split). After computing the total sum of the array elements, it sets the target sum as half of the total sum.  

A 2D boolean array dp is used where dp[i][j] indicates whether a subset with sum j can be formed using the first i+1 items of the array. The first element is used to set the initial condition: if the first element is less than or equal to the target sum, dp[0][nums[0]] is set to true.  

The algorithm then iterates through each element. For each element nums[i], it updates the DP table:  
It first copies the results from the previous element (dp[i-1][j]).  
If nums[i] equals the current subset sum j, it sets dp[i][j] to true.  
If nums[i] is less than j, it checks if the current subset sum can be formed either with or without the current item.  
If any position dp[i][sum] is true, indicating that a subset with the target sum can be formed using the first i+1 items, the method returns true. If no such subset is found after processing all elements, the method returns false. This approach effectively checks all possible subset combinations up to the target sum using the given array items.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPartition(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 1) return false;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int num : nums){
            sum += num;
        }

        if(sum % 2 == 1) return false;

        sum /= 2;

        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[nums.length][sum + 1];

        if(nums[0] <= sum) dp[0][nums[0]] = true;

        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j <= sum; j++){
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                if(nums[i] == j){
                    dp[i][j] = true;
                }
                else if(nums[i] < j){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] || dp[i - 1][j - nums[i]];
                }
            }
            if(dp[i][sum]) return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

## Thought 3:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code defines a method canPartition that determines if an array of integers can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums. The method follows these steps:  

Early Return for Single Element: If the array contains only one element, it returns false as it can't be partitioned into two equal sums.  

Sum Calculation: It calculates the total sum of all elements in the array.  

Odd Sum Check: If the sum is odd, it immediately returns false since an odd number cannot be split into two equal integer parts.
Target Sum Calculation: It divides the sum by 2 to set a target sum for each subset.  

Dynamic Programming Setup: Initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array dp where dp[j] will store the maximum sum achievable with a subset of the elements up to j.  

DP Array Population: Iterates over each element in the array (skipping the first index) and updates the DP array. It checks whether including the current element can increase the subset sum without exceeding the target.  

Subset Check: After each update of the DP array, it checks if the target sum is achieved. If so, it returns true.  

Final Return: If the loop finishes without finding two subsets with the target sum, it returns false.  

This approach uses the 0/1 knapsack problem solution where we are trying to find if there exists a subset whose sum equals half of the total sum, indicating the array can indeed be partitioned into two equal sum subsets.

            for(int j = sum; j >= nums[i]; j--){
                dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], dp[j - nums[i]] + nums[i]);
            }
