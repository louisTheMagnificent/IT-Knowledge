## Question:

You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.  

Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are at most m 0's and n 1's in the subset.  

A set x is a subset of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.  

Example 1:  

Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3  
Output: 4  

Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.  
Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.  
{"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.  

Example 2:  

Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1  
Output: 2  

Explanation: The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.  

Constraints:  

1 <= strs.length <= 600  
1 <= strs[i].length <= 100  
strs[i] consists only of digits '0' and '1'.  
1 <= m, n <= 100

## Thought:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java method findMaxForm finds the maximum number of strings that can be formed from a given list strs using at most m zeros and n ones. It utilizes a dynamic programming approach to solve a variant of the knapsack problem:  

Initialization: It starts by initializing a 2D dynamic programming array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of strings that can be formed using up to i zeros and j ones.  

Counting Zeros and Ones: For each string in strs, it counts the number of zeros (num0) and ones (num1).  

Dynamic Programming Update: It updates the dp array by iterating backward from m and n. For each string, it updates the dp table considering if including the current string increases the count of achievable strings without exceeding the limits of zeros and ones (m and n).  

Maximizing the Count: Each entry dp[i][j] is updated based on whether including a string with num0 zeros and num1 ones would provide a higher count of strings than previously possible, i.e., dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - num0][j - num1] + 1).  

Result: The method returns the value at dp[m][n], which represents the maximum number of strings that can be formed within the given constraints of zeros and ones.  

This method effectively uses the 2D DP table to track and maximize the count of strings formed under the constraints of m zeros and n ones across all input strings.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxForm(String[] strs, int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        for(String str : strs){
            int num0 = 0;
            int num1 = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++){
                if(str.charAt(i) == '0') num0++;
                else num1++;
            }

            for(int i = m; i >= num0; i--){
                for(int j = n; j >= num1; j--){
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - num0][j - num1] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```
