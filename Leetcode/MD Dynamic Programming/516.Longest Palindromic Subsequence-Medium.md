## Question:

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.  

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "bbbab"  
Output: 4  

Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "cbbd"  
Output: 2  

Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 1000  
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Thought:
We use md dp to do it.


This Java code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string s. It uses a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence within the substring from index i to j.  

Initialization: Each single character in the string is a palindrome of length 1, so all diagonal elements of the array (dp[i][i]) are initialized to 1, indicating that the shortest palindromic subsequence at every single character position is the character itself.  

Filling the DP Table: The table is filled by considering substrings of increasing length. The code starts from the end of the string and moves backward, allowing the use of previously computed results for the dynamic programming approach. For each pair (i, j) where i < j:  
If the characters at positions i and j are the same (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)), the length of the longest palindrome subsequence is the length of the subsequence between i+1 and j-1 plus 2 (adding both characters s[i] and s[j] to the palindrome).  
If the characters are different, the code checks two possibilities: either excluding the character at i or excluding the character at j, and takes the maximum value between dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i][j - 1].  

Result: After the table is completely filled, dp[0][s.length() - 1] contains the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string s, which is returned as the final result.  

This approach efficiently computes the longest palindromic subsequence by systematically building solutions for smaller subsequences and combining them to solve larger problems.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindromeSubseq(String s) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s.length()][s.length()];
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            dp[i][i] = 1;
        }
        for(int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--){
            for(int j = i + 1; j < s.length(); j++){
                if(s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
                else dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[0][s.length() - 1];
    }
}
```
