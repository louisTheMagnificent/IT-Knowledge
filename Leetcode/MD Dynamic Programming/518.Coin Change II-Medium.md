## Question:

You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.  

Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.  

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.  

The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.  

Example 1:  

Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]  
Output: 4  

Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:  
5=5  
5=2+2+1  
5=2+1+1+1  
5=1+1+1+1+1  

Example 2:  

Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]  
Output: 0  

Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.  

Example 3:  

Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]  
Output: 1  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= coins.length <= 300  
1 <= coins[i] <= 5000  
All the values of coins are unique.  
0 <= amount <= 5000

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java method change calculates the number of ways to make up a given amount with a set of coin denominations using a dynamic programming approach:  

Initialization of DP Table: A 2D DP array dp is initialized where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to make up amount j using the first i+1 types of coins.  

Base Cases:  
First Row Initialization: For the first type of coin (coins[0]), dp[0][j] is set to 1 if j is a multiple of coins[0] (i.e., the amount can be formed using only the first type of coin).  
First Column Initialization: dp[i][0] is set to 1 for all i, representing that there is exactly one way to make up amount 0 (by using no coins).  

Filling the DP Table:  
For each coin type from the second onwards (i=1 to n-1), and for each possible amount from 1 to amount:  
If the amount j is less than the coin's denomination coins[i], the value from the row above is copied (dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]).  
If j is greater than or equal to coins[i], the method adds the number of ways to make up the amount using fewer coins (dp[i - 1][j]) and the number of ways to make up the remaining amount after including one coin of the current type (dp[i][j - coins[i]).  

Result: The method returns dp[n - 1][amount], which is the number of ways to make up the amount using all available coin types.  

This solution leverages a bottom-up dynamic programming technique to systematically build up the number of ways to reach the target amount using incremental subsets of the available coins.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int n = coins.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][amount + 1];
        for(int j = coins[0]; j <= amount; j++){
            if(j % coins[0] == 0) dp[0][j] = 1;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= amount; j++){
                if(j < coins[i]) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - coins[i]];
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n - 1][amount];
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java method change calculates the number of ways to make up a given amount using a set of coin denominations through a space-optimized dynamic programming approach:  

Initialization:  
A 1D DP array dp is initialized with size amount + 1. dp[j] represents the number of ways to make up the amount j.  
dp[0] is set to 1 because there is exactly one way to make up amount 0, which is using no coins.  

First Coin Initialization:  
The method sets up initial values for making amounts that are exact multiples of the first coin (coins[0]), since these can be made by using only multiples of the first coin.  

DP Array Update:  
For each subsequent coin from the array coins, starting from the second coin (i=1), the method iterates over all amounts from the coin's value up to the amount. It updates dp[j] by adding the number of ways to make the amount j - coins[i] to the current number of ways dp[j]. This represents including the current coin in combinations that make up j.  

Result:  
The value at dp[amount] after processing all coins gives the total number of combinations that can make up the amount using the given coins.  

This approach effectively uses a single-dimensional DP array, updating it iteratively with each coin to build up the solution, thus saving space compared to a two-dimensional DP table.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
        int n = coins.length;
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        for(int j = coins[0]; j <= amount; j++){
            if(j % coins[0] == 0) dp[j] = 1;
        }
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; j++){
                dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - coins[i]];
            }
        }

        return dp[amount];
    }
}
```
