## Question:

Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same.  

In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.  

Example 1:  

Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"  
Output: 2  

Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".  

Example 2:  

Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"  
Output: 4  

Constraints:  

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500  
word1 and word2 consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code calculates the minimum edit distance between two strings word1 and word2 using dynamic programming. The 2D array dp is used where dp[i][j] represents the minimum cost to convert the first i characters of word1 into the first j characters of word2.  
Initial values are set in the dp array such that dp[i][0] is i, representing the cost of deleting all characters of word1 up to i to match an empty word2. Similarly, dp[0][j] is j, representing the cost of inserting j characters into an empty word1 to match word2.  
The algorithm then fills the dp table by comparing characters of word1 and word2. If the characters match (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)), the value is carried over from dp[i - 1][j - 1], indicating no additional cost. If the characters do not match, it calculates the cost of the three possible operations: substituting (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 2), inserting (dp[i][j - 1] + 1), or deleting (dp[i - 1][j] + 1), and takes the minimum of these options.  
The value at dp[word1.length()][word2.length()] gives the minimum cost required to transform word1 into word2.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[word1.length() + 1][word2.length() + 1];
        for(int i = 1; i <= word1.length(); i++){
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for(int j = 1; j <= word2.length(); j++){
            dp[0][j] = j;
        }

        for(int i = 1; i <= word1.length(); i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <=word2.length(); j++){
                if(word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 2, Math.min(dp[i][j - 1] + 1, dp[i - 1][j] + 1));
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[word1.length()][word2.length()];
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but 1d array.

This Java code calculates the minimum edit distance between two strings word1 and word2 using a space-optimized dynamic programming approach. Instead of using a 2D array, it utilizes a 1D array dp where dp[j] represents the minimum edit distance between the first i characters of word1 and the first j characters of word2.  
The array dp is initialized such that dp[j] = j, representing the cost of transforming an empty word1 into the first j characters of word2 by inserting each character. Similarly, dp[0] is set to i in each iteration of the outer loop, representing the cost of deleting all characters from word1 to match an empty word2.  
Inside the nested loop, prev holds the previous value of dp[j] before it was updated, serving as dp[i-1][j-1] in a full 2D approach. If the current characters of word1 and word2 match (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)), dp[j] is set to prev, indicating no additional cost for this character match. If they don't match, dp[j] is updated to the minimum of the three possible editing operations: substituting (cost of 2 added to prev), inserting (cost of 1 added to dp[j-1]), or deleting (cost of 1 added to the previous value of dp[j], which was the old dp[j]).  
The value at dp[word2.length()] after processing all characters provides the minimum edit distance required to transform word1 into word2.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int[] dp = new int[word2.length() + 1];
        for(int j = 1; j <= word2.length(); j++){
            dp[j] = j;
        }

        for(int i = 1; i <= word1.length(); i++){
            dp[0] = i;
            int prev = i - 1;

            for(int j = 1; j <=word2.length(); j++){
                int temp = dp[j];
                if(word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) dp[j] = prev;
                else{
                    dp[j] = Math.min(prev + 2, Math.min(dp[j - 1] + 1, dp[j] + 1));
                }
                prev = temp;
            }
        }

        return dp[word2.length()];
    }
}
