## Question:

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.  

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.  

Example 1:  

Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]  
Output: 7  

Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.  

Example 2:  

Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]  
Output: 12  

Constraints:  

m == grid.length  
n == grid[i].length  
1 <= m, n <= 200  
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 200

## Thought: 
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the minimum path sum in a 2D grid where each cell contains a non-negative integer. The goal is to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. Here’s a concise explanation of its design:  

Initialization: A 2D array dp is used, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum path sum to reach cell (i, j) from the top-left corner (0, 0). The top-left cell is initialized with its own value (dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]).  

Filling First Row and Column:  
The first row of dp is filled by adding the current cell in the grid to the sum accumulated from the left, effectively calculating the path sum from left to right along the top row.  
Similarly, the first column is filled by continuously adding the current cell value to the sum accumulated from above, providing the path sum from top to bottom along the left column.  

Filling the Rest of the Grid:  
For each remaining cell (i, j) in the grid (starting from 1, 1), the value is calculated by taking the minimum of the two possible paths to get to that cell: from the left (dp[i][j-1]) and from above (dp[i-1][j]). The current grid value (grid[i][j]) is added to this minimum value to update dp[i][j].  

Result:  
The bottom-right corner of the dp array (dp[grid.length - 1][grid[0].length - 1]) holds the minimum path sum for the entire grid, which is returned as the result.  

This approach ensures that the minimum sum path is found in a bottom-up manner, considering each cell only once and using previously computed results to build up the final answer efficiently.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {
    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        int[][] dp = new int[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
        for(int i = 1; i < grid.length; i++){
            dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0];
        }
        for(int j = 1; j < grid[0].length; j++){
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j];
        }
        
        for(int i = 1; i < grid.length; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j < grid[0].length; j++){
                dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[grid.length - 1][grid[0].length - 1];
    }
}
```
