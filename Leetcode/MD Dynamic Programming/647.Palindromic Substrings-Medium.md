## Question: 

Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.  

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.  

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "abc"  
Output: 3  

Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "aaa"  
Output: 6  

Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 1000  
s consists of lowercase English letters.

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code calculates the number of palindromic substrings in a given string s using dynamic programming. The approach utilizes a 2D boolean array dp where dp[i][j] is true if the substring from index i to j in s is a palindrome.  
The code initializes the diagonal of the dp array (dp[i][i]) to true for all i, since every single character is a palindrome by definition. This also starts the count of palindromic substrings with the length of the string, as each individual character is counted as a palindrome.  
The algorithm then iterates backwards over the string using two nested loops, checking substrings of increasing lengths. For each pair of indices (i, j) where i < j, it first checks if the characters at these positions are the same. If they are not, it moves on. If they are, it further checks the conditions: if j - i is 1 or 2, it immediately marks dp[i][j] as true and increments the result. This is because substrings of length 2 or 3 are palindromes if the outer characters are the same. For longer substrings, it checks if the inner substring (dp[i + 1][j - 1]) is a palindrome. If it is, then dp[i][j] is set to true, and the result is incremented.  
The final count of palindromic substrings is stored in result, which is returned at the end.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String s) {
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[s.length()][s.length()];
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            dp[i][i] = true;
        }
        int result = s.length();
        for(int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--){
            for(int j = s.length() - 1; j > i; j--){
                if(s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j)) continue;
                else{
                    if(j - i == 1 || j - i == 2){
                        result++;
                        dp[i][j] = true;
                    }
                    else if(dp[i + 1][j - 1]){
                        result++; 
                        dp[i][j] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use two pointers to do it.

This Java code counts the number of palindromic substrings in a given string s by using a center-expansion approach. It consists of a main method countSubstrings and a helper method check.  

Main Method (countSubstrings): The function iterates over each character in the string s, using each character as a potential center of a palindrome. It then calls the check method twice for each center: once considering the character as the center of an odd-length palindrome (check(s, i, i)) and once for an even-length palindrome by considering a center between two characters (check(s, i, i+1)). The results of these checks are accumulated into result, which holds the total count of palindromic substrings.  

Helper Method (check): This method expands around the potential center (left and right indices) and counts palindromic substrings as long as the characters at left and right are the same and within the bounds of the string. It increments left to move backward and right to move forward, effectively checking the substring expanding from the center outwards. Each valid palindrome found increments the result.  

The combined count from both types of centers for all indices provides the total number of palindromic substrings in the string s. The code efficiently identifies all palindromic substrings by dynamically expanding from possible centers without the need for a separate dynamic programming table.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String s) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            result += check(s, i, i);
            result += check(s, i, i + 1);
        }
        return result;
    }

    public int check(String s, int left, int right){
        int result = 0;
        while(left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)){
            result++;
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
