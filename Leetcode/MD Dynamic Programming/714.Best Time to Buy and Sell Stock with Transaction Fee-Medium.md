## Question: 

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.  

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.  

Note:  

You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).  
The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.  
 
Example 1:  

Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2  
Output: 8  

Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:  
- Buying at prices[0] = 1  
- Selling at prices[3] = 8  
- Buying at prices[4] = 4  
- Selling at prices[5] = 9  
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

Example 2:  

Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3  
Output: 6  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 104  
1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 104  
0 <= fee < 5 * 104

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code solves the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee" problem using a dynamic programming approach. The goal is to maximize profit from stock transactions considering a fee charged for each sale:  

Initialization of DP Array:  
A 2D array dp is initialized where dp[i][0] represents the maximum profit on day i when holding a stock, and dp[i][1] represents the maximum profit on day i when not holding a stock.  
dp[0][0] is initialized to -prices[0], indicating buying the stock on the first day.  

Filling the DP Table:  
For each day starting from the second day:  
dp[i][0]: Updated to the maximum of retaining the stock from the previous day (dp[i - 1][0]) or buying the stock on the current day (dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]).  
dp[i][1]: Updated to the maximum of not holding any stock from the previous day (dp[i - 1][1]) or selling the stock held from the previous day (dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i] - fee).  

Returning the Result:  
The function returns dp[prices.length - 1][1], which contains the maximum profit possible by the last day when not holding any stock.  

This approach efficiently captures the optimal decisions for each day, factoring in the cost of transaction fees, and maximizes the profit for a series of buy and sell transactions across the given period.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][2];
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i] - fee);
        }

        return dp[prices.length - 1][1];
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code implements a space-optimized dynamic programming approach to solve the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee" problem. The objective is to maximize the profit from buying and selling stocks, where each sale incurs a transaction fee:   

Initialization of DP Array:  
A 1D array dp of size 2 is used:  
dp[0] tracks the maximum profit when holding a stock.  
dp[1] tracks the maximum profit when not holding a stock.  

DP Array Updates:  
Starting with the initial condition where dp[0] is set to -prices[0] (representing the cost of buying the stock on the first day).  
For each day from the second day onward:  
dp[0] is updated to the maximum of the current dp[0] (continuing to hold the stock) or dp[1] - prices[i-1] (buying the stock today, considering the balance after not holding any stock the previous day).  
dp[1] is updated to the maximum of the current dp[1] (not buying or selling today) or dp[0] + prices[i-1] - fee (selling the stock held, accounting for the transaction fee).  

Final Output:  
The function returns dp[1], which represents the maximum profit possible without holding any stock at the end of the last day.  

This method efficiently computes the maximum possible profit using only two variables, thus minimizing space complexity while considering every day's price for optimal buy and sell decisions including the fee.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        int[] dp = new int[2];
        dp[0] = -prices[0];
        for(int i = 1; i <= prices.length; i++){
            dp[0] = Math.max(dp[0], dp[1] - prices[i - 1]);
            dp[1] = Math.max(dp[1], dp[0] + prices[i - 1] - fee);
        }

        return dp[1];
    }
}
```
