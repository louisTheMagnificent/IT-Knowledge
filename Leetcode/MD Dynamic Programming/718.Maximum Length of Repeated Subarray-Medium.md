## Question:

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return the maximum length of a subarray that appears in both arrays.  

Example 1:  
 
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,2,1], nums2 = [3,2,1,4,7]  
Output: 3  

Explanation: The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3,2,1].  

Example 2:  

Input: nums1 = [0,0,0,0,0], nums2 = [0,0,0,0,0]  
Output: 5  
Explanation: The repeated subarray with maximum length is [0,0,0,0,0].  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000  
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 100

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code solves the problem of finding the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) present in two arrays nums1 and nums2 using a dynamic programming approach:  

Initialization:  
A 2D array dp of size (nums1.length + 1) x (nums2.length + 1) is initialized, where dp[i][j] will store the length of the longest common subsequence up to nums1[i-1] and nums2[j-1].  
Initialize result to 0, which will track the maximum length of any common subsequence found.  

Filling the DP Table:  
Nested loops are used to fill the dp table. The outer loop iterates over each element of nums1 and the inner loop over each element of nums2.  
For each pair of elements from nums1 and nums2 (indexed by i and j respectively), if the elements match (nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1]), the dp[i][j] is set to dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1. This means that the current characters are part of the LCS and the sequence length is extended by 1 from the previous match found.  
After updating dp[i][j], the result is updated to be the maximum of the current result and dp[i][j].  

Returning the Result:  
The function returns result, which contains the length of the longest common subsequence found between nums1 and nums2.  

This approach efficiently computes the longest sequence of matching elements between the two arrays with a time complexity of O(n * m) where n is the length of nums1 and m is the length of nums2. The space complexity of this method is also O(n * m) due to the 2D array used for dynamic programming.

##  Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int findLength(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[nums1.length + 1][nums2.length + 1];
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= nums1.length; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= nums2.length; j++){
                if(nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1]) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                if(dp[i][j] > result) result = dp[i][j];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(mn)  
Space complexity: O(mn)

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code provides an optimized solution to find the length of the longest common contiguous subarray (not subsequence) between two arrays nums1 and nums2 using a space-optimized dynamic programming (DP) approach:  

Initialization:  
A 1D array dp is created with a length of nums2.length + 1. This DP array is used to store the length of the longest common ending at each position in nums2.  
An integer result is initialized to 0 to track the maximum length of any common contiguous subarray found during the process.  

DP Array Update:  
The outer loop iterates over each element of nums1 starting from the first element.  
The inner loop iterates over the elements of nums2 but in reverse order (from last to first). This reverse order is crucial because it ensures that the update of dp[j] uses the value of dp[j-1] from the previous state of nums1[i-1], thereby preventing overwrite issues that would occur if it looped from first to last.  
For each pair of elements (nums1[i-1] and nums2[j-1]):  
If the elements match, dp[j] is updated to dp[j-1] + 1, meaning the current length of the common contiguous subarray is increased by one.  
If they do not match, dp[j] is reset to 0, indicating the end of a common subarray up to that point.  
The result is updated to be the maximum of the current result and dp[j] after each update.  

Returning the Result:  
After completing all iterations, result holds the length of the longest common contiguous subarray between nums1 and nums2, which is then returned.  

This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n√óm), where n is the length of nums1 and m is the length of nums2. It significantly reduces space complexity to O(m) by using only a single auxiliary DP array instead of a 2D array, making it more space-efficient while still effectively solving the problem.

class Solution {
    public int findLength(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int[] dp = new int[nums2.length + 1];
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= nums1.length; i++){
            for(int j = nums2.length; j >= 1 ; j--){
                if(nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1]) dp[j] = dp[j - 1] + 1;
                else dp[j] = 0;
                if(dp[j] > result) result = dp[j];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
