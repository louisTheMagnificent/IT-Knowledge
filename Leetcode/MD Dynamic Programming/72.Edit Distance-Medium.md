## Question: 

Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.  

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:  

Insert a character  
Delete a character  
Replace a character  
 
Example 1:  

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"  
Output: 3  

Explanation:   
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')  
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')  
rose -> ros (remove 'e')  

Example 2:  

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"  
Output: 5  

Explanation:   
intention -> inention (remove 't')  
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')  
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')  
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')  
exection -> execution (insert 'u')  

Constraints:  

0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500  
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum edit distance between two strings, word1 and word2. It uses a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to transform the first i characters of word1 into the first j characters of word2.  
The code initializes the boundaries of the dp array: dp[i][0] is set to i, representing the cost of deleting all characters up to i from word1 to match an empty word2. Similarly, dp[0][j] is set to j, representing the cost of inserting j characters to transform an empty word1 into the first j characters of word2.  
The main part of the code iterates over each character of word1 and word2, updating dp[i][j]. If the characters match (word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1)), it inherits the cost from dp[i-1][j-1] as no operation is needed. If the characters do not match, it considers the minimum cost among three operations: substituting (dp[i-1][j-1] + 1), deleting (dp[i-1][j] + 1), or inserting (dp[i][j-1] + 1).  
Finally, the value at dp[word1.length()][word2.length()] gives the minimum edit distance required to convert word1 to word2.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[word1.length() + 1][word2.length() + 1];
        for(int i = 1; i <= word1.length(); i++){
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for(int j = 1; j <= word2.length(); j++){
            dp[0][j] = j;
        }

        for(int i = 1; i <= word1.length(); i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= word2.length(); j++){
                if(word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                else dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1, Math.min(dp[i - 1][j] + 1, dp[i][j - 1] + 1));
            }
        }

        return dp[word1.length()][word2.length()];
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code calculates the minimum edit distance between two strings, word1 and word2, using a space-efficient dynamic programming approach. It uses a 1D array dp where dp[j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to convert word1 up to the current point into the first j characters of word2.  
The array is initialized such that dp[j] is equal to j, accounting for transforming an empty word1 into the first j characters of word2 by insertions. Each row iteration starts by setting dp[0] to i, representing the cost of deleting all characters from word1 to match an empty word2.  
The inner loop checks each character of word1 against word2. If the characters match (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)), dp[j] is updated to prev, which holds the value of dp[j-1] from the previous iteration (i.e., dp[i-1][j-1] in a full 2D approach). If the characters do not match, dp[j] is updated to the minimum of three possible operations: substituting (prev + 1), inserting (dp[j-1] + 1), or deleting (temp + 1), where temp is the old value of dp[j].  
After processing all characters of word1, the value at dp[word2.length()] gives the minimum number of edits required to transform word1 into word2.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int[] dp = new int[word2.length() + 1];

        for(int j = 1; j <= word2.length(); j++){
            dp[j] = j;
        }

        for(int i = 1; i <= word1.length(); i++){
            dp[0] = i;
            int prev = i - 1;
            for(int j = 1; j <= word2.length(); j++){
                int temp = dp[j];
                if(word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) dp[j] = prev;
                else dp[j] = Math.min(prev + 1, Math.min(temp + 1, dp[j - 1] + 1));
                prev = temp;
            }
        }

        return dp[word2.length()];
    }
}
```
