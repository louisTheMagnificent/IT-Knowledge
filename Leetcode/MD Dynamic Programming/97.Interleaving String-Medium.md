## Question:

Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.  

An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are divided into n and m substrings respectively, such that:  

s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn  
t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm  
|n - m| <= 1  
The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...  

Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.  

Example 1:  

Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"  
Output: true  

Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:  
Split s1 into s1 = "aa" + "bc" + "c", and s2 into s2 = "dbbc" + "a".  
Interleaving the two splits, we get "aa" + "dbbc" + "bc" + "a" + "c" = "aadbbcbcac".  
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.  

Example 2:  

Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"  
Output: false  

Explanation: Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.  

Example 3:  

Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""  
Output: true  
 
Constraints:  

0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100  
0 <= s3.length <= 200  
s1, s2, and s3 consist of lowercase English letters.  
 
Follow up: Could you solve it using only O(s2.length) additional memory space?

## Thought 1:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code checks whether a string s3 is an interleaving of two other strings s1 and s2 using dynamic programming. The solution leverages a 2D boolean array dp where dp[i][j] indicates whether the first i characters of s1 and the first j characters of s2 can interleave to form the first i + j characters of s3.  

Approach details:  
Initial Checks: The function first checks if the combined lengths of s1 and s2 equal the length of s3. If not, it returns false immediately, as the lengths must match for interleaving to be possible.  

Base Cases Initialization:  
The top-left corner dp[0][0] is set to true, indicating that two empty strings can form another empty string.  
The first row dp[i][0] is filled based on whether each character of s1 up to i matches the corresponding characters of s3. The validity depends on both characters matching and the previous value being true.  
Similarly, the first column dp[0][j] checks the characters of s2 against s3.  

Filling the DP Table:  
For each cell (i, j) in dp, the code checks two conditions:  
If the character from s2 (s2.charAt(j - 1)) matches the current character in s3 (curr), and the previous state in the same row (dp[i][j-1]) was true.  
If the character from s1 (s1.charAt(i - 1)) matches curr, and the previous state in the same column (dp[i-1][j]) was true.  
The current state dp[i][j] is set to true if either of the above conditions is true, indicating that s3 up to i + j - 1 can be formed by interleaving up to i characters of s1 and j characters of s2.  

Final Decision:  
The value at dp[s1.length()][s2.length()] indicates whether the entire s3 can be formed by interleaving s1 and s2.  

This dynamic programming approach efficiently determines the possibility of interleaving by building upon smaller subproblems, ensuring that all possible interleavings are considered through iterative updates of the dp table based on character matches and previously computed results.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isInterleave(String s1, String s2, String s3) {
        if(s1.length() + s2.length() != s3.length()) return false;
        
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1];
        dp[0][0] = true;
        for(int i = 1; i <= s1.length(); i++){
            dp[i][0] = s1.charAt(i - 1) == s3.charAt(i - 1) && dp[i - 1][0];
        }
        for(int j = 1; j <= s2.length(); j++){
            dp[0][j] = s2.charAt(j - 1) == s3.charAt(j - 1) && dp[0][j - 1];
        }

        for(int i = 1; i <= s1.length(); i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= s2.length(); j++){
                char curr = s3.charAt(i + j - 1);
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j - 1] && s2.charAt(j - 1) == curr) || (dp[i - 1][j] && s1.charAt(i - 1) == curr);
            }
        }

        return dp[s1.length()][s2.length()];
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array

This Java code checks if string s3 is an interleaving of strings s1 and s2 using a space-optimized dynamic programming approach with a 1D boolean array dp. The array dp[j] indicates whether the first i characters of s1 and the first j characters of s2 can form the first i + j characters of s3.  

Detailed steps of the approach include:  
Length Check: The function first verifies if the combined lengths of s1 and s2 match the length of s3. If not, it returns false as they cannot interleave to form a different length.  

Initialize DP Array:  
dp[0] is set to true, representing that an empty s1 and an empty s2 can form an empty s3.  
The first row (considering only s2 contributing to forming s3) is initialized by checking if each successive character of s2 matches with s3 and setting dp[j] accordingly.  

DP Array Updates:  
For each character in s1 (i from 1 to s1.length), update dp[0] to check if the substring of s1 up to i can form the corresponding substring of s3.  
For each subsequent character in s2 (j from 1 to s2.length), update dp[j] based on:  
If the previous value in the dp array (dp[j-1]) was true and the current character of s2 matches the corresponding character in s3.  
If the current value of dp[j] before update (from the last iteration of s1) was true and the current character of s1 matches the corresponding character in s3.  

Final Result:  
The value of dp[s2.length()] after the last iteration provides the answer whether s3 can be formed by interleaving s1 and s2.  

This method is efficient in space as it reduces the space requirement from a 2D table to a single 1D array, while still ensuring all conditions for interleaving are checked. The updates are done in place and the solution iteratively builds on the results of previous computations.

    public boolean isInterleave(String s1, String s2, String s3) {
        if(s1.length() + s2.length() != s3.length()) return false;
        
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[s2.length() + 1];
        dp[0] = true;
        for(int j = 1; j <= s2.length(); j++){
            dp[j] = s2.charAt(j - 1) == s3.charAt(j - 1) && dp[j - 1];
        }

        for(int i = 1; i <= s1.length(); i++){
            dp[0] = s1.charAt(i - 1) == s3.charAt(i - 1) && dp[0];
            for(int j = 1; j <= s2.length(); j++){
                char curr = s3.charAt(i + j - 1);
                dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] && s2.charAt(j - 1) == curr) || (dp[j] && s1.charAt(i - 1) == curr);
            }
        }

        return dp[s2.length()];
    }
}
