## Question:

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.  

Example 1:  

Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]  
Output: 3  
 
Example 2:  

Input: points = [[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]]  
Output: 4  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= points.length <= 300  
points[i].length == 2  
-104 <= xi, yi <= 104  
All the points are unique.

## Thought:

The provided Java code calculates the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line from a given list of 2D points. Here's a brief summary of the approach:  

Edge Case Handling:  
If there's only one point, the answer is immediately 1 since only one point itself forms a line.  

Initialization:  
The answer is initialized to 2 assuming at least two points are always on the same line since two points define a line.  

Triple Nested Loop:  
The function uses three nested loops to compare every combination of three points from the list.  
i, j, and k are the indices of the points being compared.  

Slope Calculation:  
For each set of three points (i, j, and k), the code calculates the slopes between points i and j, and points i and k using cross multiplication to avoid division (and potential division by zero).  
Specifically, it checks if (y2 - y1) * (x3 - x1) == (y3 - y1) * (x2 - x1). This ensures that the slopes between i & j and i & k are equal, indicating that the points are collinear.  

Counting Collinear Points:  
A temporary counter temp is used to count how many points lie on the same line formed by points i and j.  
If the third point k is on the same line, temp is incremented.  

Max Points Update:  
After checking all possible third points for a pair of points i and j, the maximum value of temp (number of collinear points for that pair) is used to update the overall answer.  

Return Result:  
After all pairs are checked, the function returns answer, which is the maximum number of collinear points found.  

This method efficiently checks all triples of points in the dataset to determine the largest set of collinear points, using a straightforward mathematical approach to verify collinearity.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxPoints(int[][] points) {
        
        if(points.length == 1) return 1;

        int answer = 2;
    
        int n = points.length;

        for(int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++){
            for(int j = i + 1; j < n - 1; j++){
                int temp = 2;
                for(int k = j + 1; k < n; k++){
                    int a = points[i][0] - points[j][0];
                    int b = points[i][0] - points[k][0];
                    int c = points[i][1] - points[j][1];
                    int d = points[i][1] - points[k][1];
                    if(d * a == c * b) temp++;
                }
                answer = Math.max(answer, temp);
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```
