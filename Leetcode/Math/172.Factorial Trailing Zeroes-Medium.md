## Question:

Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.  

Note that n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.  

Example 1:  

Input: n = 3  
Output: 0  

Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.  

Example 2:  

Input: n = 5  
Output: 1  

Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.  

Example 3:  

Input: n = 0  
Output: 0  
 
Constraints:  

0 <= n <= 104

## Thought:

The Java code provided is a solution to calculate the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a given integer n. It specifically addresses how many times the factorial result ends with the digit zero. Here's a concise breakdown of the method's strategy:  

Strategy:  
Count Factors of 5: Trailing zeros in a factorial are produced by pairs of factors 2 and 5. Since there are typically more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial sequence, the number of trailing zeros is determined by how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n.  

Method:  
Loop Until n Reduces to Zero:  
In each iteration, n is divided by 5, reducing n to the count of numbers up to n that are multiples of 5. This effectively counts how many times 5 is a factor in the sequence leading up to n!.  
The result of each division (how many 5's are factors) is added to the count.  
Return the Total Count:  
After n is reduced to zero, count holds the total number of times 5 appeared as a factor, which directly translates to the number of trailing zeros in n!.  

Summary:  
This method efficiently calculates the number of trailing zeros in n! by counting the multiples of 5 up to n, leveraging the fact that every multiple of 5 contributes to a trailing zero in the factorial. This approach ensures a quick and accurate calculation with a time complexity of O(log_5 n).

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while(n != 0){
            n /= 5;
            count += n;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(log5n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
