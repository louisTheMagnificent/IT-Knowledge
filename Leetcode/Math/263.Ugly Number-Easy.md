## Question:

An ugly number is a positive integer which does not have a prime factor other than 2, 3, and 5.  

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.  

Example 1:  

Input: n = 6  
Output: true  

Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3 

Example 2:  

Input: n = 1  
Output: true  

Explanation: 1 has no prime factors.  

Example 3:  

Input: n = 14  
Output: false  

Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.  
 
Constraints:  

-231 <= n <= 231 - 1

## Thought: 
If the number is less than 1, return false. If equal, return true. Else keep divide the number by 2, 3, 5 until the remainder is not 0. If 
the last number is 1, return true. Else return false.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isUgly(int n) {
        if(n <= 0) return false;
        if(n == 1) return true;

        while(n % 2 == 0){
            n /= 2;
        }

        while(n % 3 == 0){
            n /= 3;
        }
        
        while(n % 5 == 0){
            n /= 5;
        }

        if(n == 1) return true;
        else return false;
    }
}
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
