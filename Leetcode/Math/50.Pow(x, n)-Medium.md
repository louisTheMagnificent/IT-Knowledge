## Question: 

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).  

Example 1:  

Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10  
Output: 1024.00000  

Example 2:  

Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3  
Output: 9.26100  

Example 3:  

Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2  
Output: 0.25000  

Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25  
 
Constraints:  

-100.0 < x < 100.0  
-231 <= n <= 231-1  
n is an integer.  
Either x is not zero or n > 0.  
-104 <= xn <= 104

## Thought:

The Java code provided is an implementation of the "Exponentiation by Squaring" algorithm to calculate x^n efficiently, where x is a double and n is an integer. Here's a concise overview of how it operates:  

Key Steps in the Implementation:  

Handle Special Cases:  
If x is 0, return 0 immediately.  
If n is 0, return 1 since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.  

Manage Negative Exponents:  
If n is negative, invert x (x = 1/x) and make n positive to simplify computation.  

Efficient Power Calculation:  
Use a loop to square x and reduce n by half until n reaches zero.  
If n is odd, multiply the result accumulator (answer) by x and decrement n.  
If n is even, square x and halve n.  

Efficiency:  
This method computes the power in O(log n) time by reducing the number of multiplicative operations, making it much more efficient than direct multiplication for large n.  

Result:  
The loop continues adjusting x and answer until n is zero, at which point answer contains the final result of x^n, which is then returned.  

This implementation efficiently handles both positive and negative powers and is effective for floating-point bases, offering a reliable way to compute powers quickly.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if(x == 0) return 0;
        
        if(n == 0) return 1;

        double answer = 1; 

        long power = n;
        if(power < 0){
            x = 1 / x;
            power = -power;
        }

        while(power > 0){
            if(power % 2 == 1){
                answer *= x;
                power -= 1;
            }
            else{
                x *= x;
                power /= 2; 
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(logn)  
Space complexity: O(1)
