## Question:

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.  

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.   

Example 1:  

Input: digits = [1,2,3]  
Output: [1,2,4]  

Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.  
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.  
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].  

Example 2:  

Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]  
Output: [4,3,2,2]  

Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.  
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.  
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].  

Example 3:  

Input: digits = [9]  
Output: [1,0]  
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.  
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.  
Thus, the result should be [1,0].  

Constraints:  

1 <= digits.length <= 100  
0 <= digits[i] <= 9  
digits does not contain any leading 0's.

## Thought:
The optimized plusOne method is designed to increment an array digits where each element represents a single digit of a non-negative integer in reverse order, with the first element being the highest digit. The approach involves iterating over the array from the least significant digit (the end of the array) to the most significant digit. If a digit less than 9 is encountered, it's incremented and the function returns immediately as no further changes are needed. If the digit is 9, it is set to 0 and the loop continues to handle a carry. If the loop completes without returning (all digits were 9), a new larger array is created to accommodate the carry over, initializing the first digit to 1 (for the new carry) and the rest to 0, then returned. This method directly manipulates the array for efficiency, avoiding additional data structures and minimizing operations.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution{
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits){
        int n = digits.length;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--){
            if (digits[i] < 9){
                digits[i]++;
                return digits;
            }
            digits[i] = 0;
        }
        int[] newDigits = new int[n + 1];
        newDigits[0] = 1;
        return newDigits;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)
