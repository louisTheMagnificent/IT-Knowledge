## Question:

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.  

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).  

Example 1:  

Input: x = 123  
Output: 321  

Example 2:  

Input: x = -123  
Output: -321  

Example 3:  
 
Input: x = 120  
Output: 21  
 
Constraints:  

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

## Thought:
This Java code implements a method to reverse the digits of an integer x. It uses a loop to extract each digit by taking the modulus by 10 and checks for overflow conditions before appending the digit to the reversed number. If appending would cause the reversed number to exceed the limits for a 32-bit integer, it returns 0 to indicate overflow; otherwise, it continues building the reversed number. The loop runs until all digits of x are processed, and then the reversed integer is returned if no overflow occurs.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        int reverse = 0;
        while(x != 0){
            int remainder = x % 10;
            if(reverse > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 || (reverse == Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 && remainder > 7)) return 0;
            else if(reverse < Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 || (reverse == Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10 && remainder < -8)) return 0;
            reverse = reverse * 10 + remainder;
            x /= 10;
        }

        return reverse;
    }
}
```
