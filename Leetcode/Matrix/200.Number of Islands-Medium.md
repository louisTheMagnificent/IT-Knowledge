## Question: 

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [  
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]  
]  
Output: 1  

Example 2:  

Input: grid = [  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]  
]  
Output: 3  
 
Constraints:  

m == grid.length  
n == grid[i].length  
1 <= m, n <= 300  
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

## Thought 1:
We use DFS to do it. We start at the first element. When the current character is 1, it means we reach an island and we add 1 to the 
result and start doing the DFS. In the DFS, first we set current character as 0 which means current position is traversed. Then we do the 
DFS to its neighbours until all the connected positions which hold 1 is traversed and all set as 0. It means we traversed the island completely. 
And we return the result after we finish the traversal.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int result = 0;
        int n = grid.length, m = grid[0].length;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < m; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == '1'){
                    result++;
                    dfs(i, j, grid);
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    private void dfs(int x, int y, char[][] grid){
        grid[x][y] = '0';
        if(y - 1 >= 0 && grid[x][y - 1] == '1') dfs(x, y - 1, grid);
        if(y + 1 < grid[0].length && grid[x][y + 1] == '1') dfs(x, y + 1, grid);
        if(x - 1 >= 0 && grid[x - 1][y] == '1') dfs(x - 1, y, grid);
        if(x + 1 < grid.length && grid[x + 1][y] == '1') dfs(x + 1, y, grid);       
    }
}
```

Space complexity: O(1)

## Thought 2:
We can use BFS as well and this time we do not change the grid. Instead, we use a set to store the position we have visited, we use string to present the axises of the position.

## Solution: 2:
```Java
class Solution {

    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int result = 0;
        int n = grid.length, m = grid[0].length;
        Queue<String> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < m; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == '1' && !set.contains(integerToString(i,j))){
                    result++;
                    queue.add(integerToString(i,j));
                    bfs(queue, set, grid);
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    private void bfs(Queue<String> queue, Set<String> set, char[][] grid) {
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++){
                String position = queue.remove();
                if (!set.contains(position)){
                    set.add(position);
                    String[] positionString = position.split(",");
                    int x = Integer.parseInt(positionString[0]);
                    int y = Integer.parseInt(positionString[1]);

                    enqueueIfValid(x, y - 1, queue, set, grid);
                    enqueueIfValid(x, y + 1, queue, set, grid);
                    enqueueIfValid(x - 1, y, queue, set, grid);
                    enqueueIfValid(x + 1, y, queue, set, grid);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private String integerToString(int x, int y){
        return Integer.toString(x) + "," + Integer.toString(y);
    }

    private void enqueueIfValid(int x, int y, Queue<String> queue, Set<String> set, char[][] grid) {
        if (x >= 0 && x < grid.length && y >= 0 && y < grid[0].length && grid[x][y] == '1') {
            String newPos = integerToString(x, y);
            if (!set.contains(newPos)){
                queue.add(newPos);
            }
        }
    }    
}
