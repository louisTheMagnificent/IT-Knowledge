## Question: 

According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."  

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):  

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.  
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.  
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.  
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.  
The next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board. In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously.  

Given the current state of the board, update the board to reflect its next state.  

Note that you do not need to return anything.  

Example 1:  

Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]  
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]  

Example 2:  

Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]  
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]  
 
Constraints:  

m == board.length  
n == board[i].length  
1 <= m, n <= 25  
board[i][j] is 0 or 1.  
 
Follow up:  

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.  

In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

## Thought:

This Java code is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton where each cell's survival depends on its neighbors. The board is represented by a 2D array, where 1 indicates a live cell and 0 indicates a dead cell.  

The algorithm proceeds in two main steps:  

Count Neighbors and Mark Changes: For each cell in the board, it counts the number of live neighbors. Depending on the number of live neighbors and the current state of the cell, it marks cells for change:  

Cells that will die due to under-population (fewer than two neighbors) or over-population (more than three neighbors) are temporarily set to Integer.MAX_VALUE.  

Cells that will become alive due to reproduction (exactly three neighbors) are set to Integer.MIN_VALUE.  

Update Board: In a second pass over the board, the cells marked with Integer.MAX_VALUE are set to 0 (dead), and cells marked with Integer.MIN_VALUE are set to 1 (alive).  

This approach allows the board to be updated in-place without needing an additional matrix, using temporary extreme values to store the next state of the board without interfering with the counting of live neighbors for other cells.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        for(int i = 0; i < board.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++){
                int count = 0;
                if(i - 1 >= 0 && j - 1 >= 0 && board[i - 1][j - 1] > 0){
                    count++;
                }
                if(j - 1 >= 0 && board[i][j - 1] > 0){
                    count++;
                }
                if(i + 1 < board.length && j - 1 >= 0 && board[i + 1][j - 1] > 0){
                    count++;
                }
                if(i - 1 >= 0 && board[i - 1][j] > 0){
                    count++;
                }
                if(i + 1 < board.length && board[i + 1][j] > 0){
                    count++;
                }
                if(i - 1 >= 0 && j + 1 < board[0].length && board[i - 1][j + 1] > 0){
                    count++;
                }
                if(j + 1 < board[0].length && board[i][j + 1] > 0){
                    count++;
                }
                if(i + 1 < board.length && j + 1 < board[0].length && board[i + 1][j + 1] > 0){
                    count++;
                }

                if((count < 2 || count > 3) && board[i][j] == 1){
                    board[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                }

                if(count == 3 && board[i][j] == 0){
                    board[i][j] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                }
            }
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < board.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++){
                if(board[i][j] == Integer.MAX_VALUE){
                    board[i][j] = 0;
                }
                if(board[i][j] == Integer.MIN_VALUE){
                    board[i][j] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
