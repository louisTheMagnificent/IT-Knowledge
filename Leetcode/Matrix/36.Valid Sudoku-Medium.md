## Question:

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:  

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.  
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.  
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.  

Note:  

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.  
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.  
 
Example 1:  

Input: board =   
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]  
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]  
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]  
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]  
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]  
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]  
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]  
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]  
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]  
Output: true  

Example 2:  

Input: board =   
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]  
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]  
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]  
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]  
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]  
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]  
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]  
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]  
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]  
Output: false  

Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.  

Constraints:  

board.length == 9  
board[i].length == 9  
board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

## Thought:
We use a hashSet to help us to do it.

The provided Java code checks the validity of a Sudoku board. It uses a single HashSet to track the presence of digits in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. Here's a brief summary of how the code works:  

Row Validation:  
Iterates through each row of the board.  
Clears the HashSet for each new row to start fresh.  
Checks each cell; if it contains a number, the code verifies that this number hasn't appeared previously in the same row using the set.  

Column Validation:  
Similar to row validation but iterates column-wise.  
Clears the set for each new column and checks for duplicates within the column.  

Subgrid Validation:  
Uses nested loops to access each 3x3 subgrid.  
For each subgrid, clears the set and checks each cell to ensure no numbers are repeated within that grid.  

The function returns false if any duplicates are found in a row, column, or subgrid. If all checks pass without finding duplicates, it returns true, indicating the board is valid. Each segment of the board is handled sequentially, ensuring that all Sudoku rules are followed.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++){
            set.clear();
            for(int j = 0; j < 9; j++){
                if(board[i][j] == '.') continue;
                else if(set.contains(board[i][j])) return false;
                else set.add(board[i][j]);
            }
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++){
            set.clear();
            for(int j = 0; j < 9; j++){
                if(board[j][i] == '.') continue;
                else if(set.contains(board[j][i])) return false;
                else set.add(board[j][i]);
            }
        }

        for(int startI = 0; startI < 3; startI++){
            for(int startJ = 0; startJ < 3; startJ++){
                set.clear();
                for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
                    for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++){
                        if(board[startI * 3 + i][startJ * 3 + j] == '.') continue;
                        else if(set.contains(board[startI * 3 + i][startJ * 3 + j])) return false;
                        else set.add(board[startI * 3 + i][startJ * 3 + j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
