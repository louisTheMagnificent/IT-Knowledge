## Question:

Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.  

You must do it in place.  

Example 1:  

Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]  
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]  

Example 2:  

Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]  
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]  
 
Constraints:  

m == matrix.length  
n == matrix[0].length  
1 <= m, n <= 200  
-231 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1  
 
Follow up:  

A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.  
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.  
Could you devise a constant space solution?

## Thought:

This Java code is designed to set matrix rows and columns to zero if any element in them is zero. The solution operates in-place, using the first row and the first column of the matrix to mark which rows and columns need to be zeroed, thereby avoiding the need for additional memory.  

The algorithm begins by checking if the first row or the first column contains any zeros, storing this information in startright and startdown. It then iterates through the matrix, and if an element is zero, it sets the corresponding first row and first column elements to zero as markers.  

In the second pass, it checks these markers (excluding the first row and column initially) to set the appropriate matrix elements to zero. Finally, it uses startright and startdown to determine if the first row and/or first column should be set to zero based on their original values. This approach ensures that all appropriate elements are zeroed correctly while preserving the state of the first row and column until the end.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {

        int startdown = matrix[0][0];
        int startright = matrix[0][0];
        for(int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length; j++){
                if(matrix[i][j] == 0){
                    if(j == 0) startdown = 0;
                    if(i == 0) startright = 0;
                    matrix[0][j] = 0;
                    matrix[i][0] = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        for(int i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j < matrix[0].length; j++){
                if(matrix[i][0] == 0 || matrix[0][j] == 0){
                    matrix[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        if(startright == 0){
            for(int i = 0; i < matrix[0].length; i++){
                matrix[0][i] = 0;
            }
        }
        if(startdown == 0){
            for(int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++){
                matrix[i][0] = 0;
            }
        }

        return;
    }
}
```
