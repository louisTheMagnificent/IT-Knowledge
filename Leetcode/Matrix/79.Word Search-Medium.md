## Question:

Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example 1:

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"  
Output: true  

Example 2:  

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"  
Output: true  

Example 3:

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"  
Output: false  
 
Constraints:  

m == board.length  
n = board[i].length  
1 <= m, n <= 6  
1 <= word.length <= 15  
board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

## Thought:
We use backTrack to do it. First we need to set a hashset to store the position we have visited. Then we start at the first character and do the 
backTrack. In the backTrack, if the currentIndex is equal to the length of the word, it means we have find a path with word so we return true. 
If the current position is out of bound or the position is visited or the character is not equal to word.charAt(currentIndex), we return false.
Or we add the current node into the set and do the backtrack to its neighbours with a new currentIndex (currentIndex + 1). After that we delete the current 
position. If one of its neighbours return true, we return true.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {

    private int m;
    private int n;
    private Set<String> visited;
    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        m = board.length;
        n = board[0].length;
        visited = new HashSet<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if(backTrack(board, word, j, i, 0)) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean backTrack(char[][] board, String word, int x, int y, int currentIndex){
        if(currentIndex == word.length()){
            return true;
        } 
        
        if(x < 0 || x >= n || y < 0 || y >= m || visited.contains(x + "," + y) || 
           word.charAt(currentIndex) != board[y][x]) return false;

        visited.add(x + "," + y);
        boolean result = backTrack(board, word, x - 1, y, currentIndex + 1)||
                         backTrack(board, word, x + 1, y, currentIndex + 1)||
                         backTrack(board, word, x, y - 1, currentIndex + 1)||
                         backTrack(board, word, x, y + 1, currentIndex + 1);
        visited.remove(x + "," + y);
        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(m * n * 4 * len(word))  
Space complexity: O(len(word))
