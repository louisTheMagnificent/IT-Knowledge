## Question:

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.   

Example 1:

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]  
Output: 6  

Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.  

Example 2:  

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]  
Output: 9  
 
Constraints:  

n == height.length  
1 <= n <= 2 * 104  
0 <= height[i] <= 105

## Thought:
We use a stack to do it. This Java code implements a solution to the "Trapping Rain Water" problem using a stack data structure. The stack is used to track indices of the bars in the terrain profile. Initially, a sentinel value of -1 is pushed onto the stack to handle edge cases. The code then iterates over each bar in the terrain:  
For each bar at index i, it checks if the current bar's height is greater than the height of the bar at the index currently on top of the stack. If so, it indicates a possible container end that can trap water.  
The stack's top index is popped to calculate the potential trapped water. If the stack is empty after popping (i.e., reaches the sentinel), the loop breaks as there's no left boundary to contain water.  
The water trapped is calculated by determining the minimum height between the current bar and the new top of the stack (acting as boundaries), subtracting the height of the popped bar (bottom of the container), and then multiplying by the width between the current index and the new top of the stack.  
After processing, the current index is pushed onto the stack.  
This approach efficiently calculates the trapped water by using the stack to remember and compare the necessary boundaries of potential water traps.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        int result = 0;
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(-1);
        int i = 0;
        while(i < height.length){
            while(stack.peek() != -1 && height[i] > height[stack.peek()]){
                int index = stack.pop();
                if(stack.peek() == -1) break;
                int currHeight = Math.min(height[i], height[stack.peek()]) - height[index];
                int width = i - stack.peek() - 1;
                result += width * currHeight;
            }
            stack.push(i);
            i++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
