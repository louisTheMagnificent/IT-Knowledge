## Question

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.  

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.  

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.  

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]  
Output: [-1,3,-1]  

Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:  
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.  
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.  
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]  
Output: [3,-1]  

Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:  
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.  
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000  
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104  
All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.  
All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.  
 
Follow up: Could you find an O(nums1.length + nums2.length) solution?

## Thought:
We use a monotonic stack and a hashmap to do it.

The nextGreaterElement method in the Solution class finds the next greater element for each number in the array nums1 from another array nums2, where nums2 is a superset containing all the elements of nums1. Here's a detailed breakdown of the algorithm:  

Initialization:  
A Map<Integer, Integer> called map is used to store the indices of elements from nums1 for quick lookup. This map maps each element in nums1 to its corresponding index.  
A Stack<Integer> called stack is utilized to hold indices of nums2 during traversal.  
An integer array result is initialized to the length of nums1 with all elements set to -1. This will store the next greater element for each corresponding element in nums1.  

Mapping Elements from nums1:  
Iterate over nums1 and populate the map with each element's value as the key and its index in the array as the value.  

Finding Next Greater Elements:  

Traverse through the nums2 array:  
For each element nums2[i], compare it with the element at the index on top of the stack (i.e., nums2[stack.peek()]).  
If nums2[i] is greater than the top of the stack (i.e., it is the next greater element for the element represented by the index at the top of the stack), pop the stack to get the index, and then check if this element exists in nums1 using the map.  
If the popped element from nums2 (using the index from the stack) is in nums1, update the result array at the mapped index with the current nums2[i].  
Push the current index i of nums2 onto the stack for future comparison.  

Stack Management:  
The stack helps in keeping track of the elements for which the next greater element has not yet been found as the traversal through nums2 continues.  

Returning the Result:   
After completing the traversal of nums2, the result array contains the next greater element for each element in nums1 that can be found in nums2. If no greater element is found, the value remains -1.  

This method efficiently determines the next greater elements by using a stack to handle comparisons and a hashmap for quick access to indices, ensuring that each element from nums1 is matched correctly against potential greater elements in nums2.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElement(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        int[] result = new int[nums1.length];
        Arrays.fill(result, -1);

        for(int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++){
            map.put(nums1[i], i);
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < nums2.length; i++){
            while(!stack.isEmpty() && nums2[i] > nums2[stack.peek()]){
                int index = stack.pop();
                if(map.containsKey(nums2[index])){
                    result[map.get(nums2[index])] = nums2[i];
                }
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
