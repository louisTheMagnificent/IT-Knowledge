## Question:

Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.  

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,2,1]  
Output: [2,-1,2]  

Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2;   
The number 2 can't find next greater number.   
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]  
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 104  
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Thought:
We use a monotonic stack and double size to do it.

The nextGreaterElements method in the Solution class finds the next greater element for each element in a circular array nums. This method ensures that every element is checked not only against the elements that follow it in the array but also considers the elements at the beginning of the array due to the circular nature. Here's a breakdown of how the method is implemented:  

Initialization:  
An integer array result is initialized with the same length as nums and all elements set to -1. This array will store the next greater element for each index.  
A Stack<Integer> called stack is used to hold indices of nums. The stack helps track indices for which a greater next element has not yet been found.  

Handling the Circular Array:  
The method loops through the nums array twice (i.e., for 2 * nums.length) to handle the circular nature of the array. This allows every element to be compared with every other element in the array as if the array were laid out twice consecutively.  
The index for accessing elements in nums during the loop uses i % nums.length to wrap around once i exceeds the length of nums.  

Finding Next Greater Elements:  
Within the loop, while the stack is not empty and the current element nums[i % nums.length] is greater than the element at the index on the top of the stack (nums[stack.peek()]):  
Pop the index from the stack and set result at this index to the current element nums[i % nums.length], as this is the next greater element for that index.  
Push the current index i % nums.length onto the stack. This index will later be compared with subsequent elements as the loop continues.  

Stack and Index Management:  
By pushing the remainder of the division i % nums.length onto the stack, we maintain valid indices within the bounds of the original array size.  
Elements for which a greater element is not found by the end of the second traversal remain -1 in the result array.  

Returning the Result:  
After completing the traversal, the result array, which now contains the next greater element for each position or -1 if no such element exists, is returned.  

This method effectively and efficiently finds the next greater element for all elements in a circular array, using a stack to manage indices and looping twice to account for the circular nature of the problem.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
        
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(result, -1);
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < 2 * nums.length; i++){
            while(!stack.isEmpty() && nums[i % nums.length] > nums[stack.peek()]){
                result[stack.pop()] = nums[i % nums.length];
            }
            stack.push(i % nums.length);
        }

        return result;

    }
}
```
