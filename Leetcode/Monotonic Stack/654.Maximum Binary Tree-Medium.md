## Question :

You are given an integer array nums with no duplicates. A maximum binary tree can be built recursively from nums using the following algorithm:  

Create a root node whose value is the maximum value in nums.  
Recursively build the left subtree on the subarray prefix to the left of the maximum value.  
Recursively build the right subtree on the subarray suffix to the right of the maximum value.  
Return the maximum binary tree built from nums.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [3,2,1,6,0,5]  
Output: [6,3,5,null,2,0,null,null,1]  

Explanation: The recursive calls are as follow:  
- The largest value in [3,2,1,6,0,5] is 6. Left prefix is [3,2,1] and right suffix is [0,5].  
    - The largest value in [3,2,1] is 3. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [2,1].  
        - Empty array, so no child.  
        - The largest value in [2,1] is 2. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [1].  
            - Empty array, so no child.  
            - Only one element, so child is a node with value 1.  
    - The largest value in [0,5] is 5. Left prefix is [0] and right suffix is [].  
        - Only one element, so child is a node with value 0.  
        - Empty array, so no child.

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [3,2,1]  
Output: [3,null,2,null,1]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 1000  
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000  
All integers in nums are unique.

## Thought 1:

We use DFS to do it.  

This Java code implements a solution to construct a maximum binary tree as described by a problem where each node in the binary tree is the largest element in an array slice, with its left and right children being the largest elements of the non-overlapping left and right subarrays formed by splitting the array at the maximum element. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the code’s design and logic:  

Base Cases:  
The constructMaximumBinaryTree method first checks if the input array nums is empty, returning null if it is, indicating no tree can be constructed.  
If the array has only one element, it returns a new tree node with that single value, as no further splits are required.  

Recursive Construction (findNode method):   
The findNode function is the core of the recursive construction process. It takes the array nums and a range defined by start and end indices.  
If the start index is not less than the end index (start >= end), it returns null, signaling no elements are present in the current slice to form a tree node.  

Finding the Maximum Element (findMax method):   
This function iterates through the segment of the array between start and end indices to find the maximum element and its index.  
The max variable is initialized with the value at the start index, and maxIndex is set to start. As it iterates through the specified range, it updates these values whenever a larger element is found.  

Node Creation and Recursion:  
Back in findNode, once the maximum index (maxIndex) is identified, a new TreeNode is instantiated with the maximum value.  
The function then recursively constructs the left subtree from the array portion before the maximum element (start to maxIndex) and the right subtree from the portion after the maximum element (maxIndex + 1 to end).  

Recursive Calls:  
The recursive calls for curr.left and curr.right are made with the updated ranges. These calls will continue to break down the array segments until the base case of an empty range is reached, at which point null will be returned for that subtree.  

Returning the Constructed Tree:  
The findNode function eventually returns the root of the constructed subtree, and through recursive returns, builds up the entire tree, which is then returned by the initial call from constructMaximumBinaryTree.  

This solution is effective for constructing a maximum binary tree where each node represents the maximum value in the respective subarray. The recursive divide-and-conquer approach ensures that every element of the array is placed correctly according to the rules of the maximum binary tree, with efficient navigation and partitioning of the array into subarrays around the maximum elements.

 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}

class Solution {

    public TreeNode constructMaximumBinaryTree(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 0) return null;
        else if(nums.length == 1) return new TreeNode(nums[0]);

        return findNode(nums, 0, nums.length);
    }

    public TreeNode findNode(int[] nums, int start, int end){
        if(start >= end) return null;

        int maxIndex = findMax(nums, start, end);
        TreeNode curr = new TreeNode(nums[maxIndex]);
        curr.left = findNode(nums, start, maxIndex);
        curr.right = findNode(nums, maxIndex + 1, end);

        return curr;
    }

    public int findMax(int[] nums, int start, int end){
        int max = nums[start];
        int maxIndex = start;
        for(int i = start; i < end; i++){
            if(nums[i] > max){
                max = nums[i];
                maxIndex = i;
            }  
        }
        return maxIndex;
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use a monotonic stack to do it.

The provided Java code defines a method constructMaximumBinaryTree in the Solution class, which constructs a maximum binary tree from a given array of integers using a stack-based approach. Here's a summary of the algorithm's design:  

Initialization:  
A Stack<TreeNode> is initialized to help build the tree. The first element of the array nums is used to create a TreeNode and pushed onto the stack.  

Tree Construction Loop:  
Iterate through the nums array starting from the second element. 
For each element:  
Create a new TreeNode curr.  
If curr.val (the value of the current node) is less than the value of the node at the top of the stack (stack.peek().val), set the right child of the node at the top of the stack to curr, and then push curr onto the stack.  
If curr.val is greater than the top node's value, pop nodes from the stack until you find a node that has a value less than curr.val or the stack becomes empty. The last node popped (which has a smaller value than curr) is set as the left child of curr. If the stack is not empty after popping, set the right child of the new top node to curr.  
Push curr onto the stack.  

Finalizing the Tree:  
After the loop, nodes may still remain in the stack. Pop all nodes except the last one (the bottom-most node in the stack), which represents the root of the constructed tree.  

Returning the Root:  
The last node remaining in the stack, which is the root of the maximum binary tree, is returned.  

This method efficiently constructs the maximum binary tree by maintaining a stack of nodes that are potential parents for future nodes. By ensuring that nodes in the stack are in decreasing order, the algorithm correctly assigns parent-child relationships based on the maximum tree property. This stack-based approach avoids the need for recursive calls or extensive searching for the correct parent node, making it efficient in terms of time complexity.
