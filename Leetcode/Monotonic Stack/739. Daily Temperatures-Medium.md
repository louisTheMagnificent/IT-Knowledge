## Question:

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.  

Example 1:  

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]  
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]  

Example 2:  

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]  
Output: [1,1,1,0]  

Example 3:

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]  
Output: [1,1,0]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= temperatures.length <= 105  
30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

## Thought:
We use a monotonic stack to do it.

The dailyTemperatures method in the Solution class uses a monotonic stack to solve the problem of finding how many days one has to wait until a warmer temperature. Here's a breakdown of the algorithm's design:  

Initialization:  
An integer array result is initialized with the same length as the temperatures array to store the number of days until a warmer temperature is found.  
A Stack<Integer> called monotonicStack is used to hold indices of the temperatures array.  

Traversing the Temperatures:  
Iterate through the temperatures array. For each temperature, the algorithm checks if the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the index on the top of the stack (i.e., the last recorded day with a lower temperature).  

Updating Results:  
While the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the index on the top of the stack, pop the index from the stack. Calculate the difference between the current day (i) and the popped index to determine the number of days until a warmer temperature. This difference is stored in the result array at the corresponding index.  
Push the current index i onto the stack.  

Handling Remaining Indices:  
After finishing the loop, any remaining indices in the stack represent days for which there is no future warmer temperature. Set their corresponding entries in the result array to 0.  

Return the Result:  
Return the result array, which now contains the number of days one must wait for a warmer temperature for each day in the input array.  
This method efficiently computes the result by leveraging a monotonic stack to keep track of indices that have not yet found a warmer day, updating results as soon as a warmer day is found during the traversal.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
        
        int[] result = new int[temperatures.length];
        Stack<Integer> monotonicStack = new Stack();

        for(int i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++){
            while(!monotonicStack.isEmpty() && temperatures[i] > temperatures[monotonicStack.peek()]){
                int index = monotonicStack.pop();
                result[index] = i - index;
            }
            monotonicStack.push(i);
        }
        while(!monotonicStack.isEmpty()){
            int index = monotonicStack.pop();
            result[index] = 0;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
