## Question:

Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.  

Example 1:  

Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]  
Output: 10  

Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.  
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.  

Example 2:  

Input: heights = [2,4]  
Output: 4  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= heights.length <= 105  
0 <= heights[i] <= 104

## Thought: 
We use a monotonic stack to do it.


The largestRectangleArea method in the Solution class calculates the largest rectangular area that can be formed in a histogram, where the histogram is represented by an array heights of bar heights. This implementation uses a stack to efficiently determine the maximum area. Hereâ€™s how the algorithm works:  

Initialization:  
An augmented array compare is created from heights by adding two extra elements: a 0 at the beginning and a 0 at the end. This ensures that all bars are processed, including the smallest ones, as the added zeroes act as boundaries that force the stack to empty at the end.  
A Stack<Integer> called stack is initialized to help find the left and right boundaries of each bar for the maximum area calculations.  

Stack Filling:
The algorithm starts by pushing the index 0 (representing the first boundary) onto the stack.  
It then iterates through the compare array:  
If the current bar's height (compare[i]) is greater than the bar at the stack's top index, it is pushed onto the stack because it might extend the potential rectangle to the right.  
If it is equal to the bar at the stack's top, the top index is replaced with the current index to update the boundary for future rectangles.  
If it is less than the bar at the stack's top, the algorithm repeatedly pops from the stack and calculates potential rectangle areas until it finds a bar that is not taller than compare[i].  

Area Calculation:  
Whenever a pop operation occurs (because compare[i] is less than the height of the stack's top), it calculates the area of the rectangle:  
The height of the rectangle (h) is determined by the height of the popped bar (compare[midIndex]).  
The width (w) is calculated based on the difference between the current index i and the new stack's top after the pop, minus one (to account for boundaries).  
The maximum area found (result) is updated if the newly calculated area is larger.  

Finalizing and Returning the Result:  
After the loop completes (i.e., after processing all bars including the added boundary at the end), the result will hold the maximum rectangular area found.   
This approach, utilizing a stack along with a strategically augmented array, ensures that each bar is used to calculate potential maximal rectangles efficiently, maintaining a time complexity of O(n) as each bar is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int[] compare = new int[heights.length + 2];
        compare[0] = 0;
        compare[compare.length - 1] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < compare.length - 1; i++){
            compare[i] = heights[i - 1];
        }

        int result = 0;

        stack.push(0);
        for(int i = 1; i < compare.length; i++){
            if(compare[i] > compare[stack.peek()]){
                stack.push(i);
            }
            else if(compare[i] == compare[stack.peek()]){
                stack.pop();
                stack.push(i);
            }
            else{
                while(compare[i] < compare[stack.peek()]){
                    int midIndex = stack.pop();
                    int h = compare[midIndex];
                    int w = i - stack.peek() - 1;
                    result = Math.max(result, h * w);
                }
                stack.push(i);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)
