## Question:

You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.  

Return the max sliding window.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3  
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]  

Explanation:   

Window position                Max  
---------------               -----  
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3  
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3  
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5  
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5  
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6  
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7  
 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1  
Output: [1]  

Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 105  
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104  
1 <= k <= nums.length

## Thought:
We use sliding window to do it. The provided Java code implements a sliding window approach to find the maximum value in each window of size k in an array. It utilizes a deque (double-ended queue) to maintain the indices of potential maximum values within the current window. The deque ensures that its elements are always in descending order so that the front of the deque always holds the index of the maximum value for the current window. As the window slides through the array from left to right, the algorithm efficiently updates the deque by removing indices that are out of the current window and adding new indices in a way that maintains the order. The result is then collected in a list and converted to an array before returning. This approach optimizes the sliding window problem by ensuring each element is processed at most twice, achieving linear time complexity.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            int num = nums[i];
            
            while(!deque.isEmpty() && deque.getLast() < num){
                deque.pollLast();
            }
            deque.addLast(num);

            if(i >= k && nums[i - k] == deque.getFirst()){
                deque.pollFirst();
            }

            if(i >= k - 1){
                result.add(deque.getFirst());
            }
        }

        return result.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray();
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(k)
