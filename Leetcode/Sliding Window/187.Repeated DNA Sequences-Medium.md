## Question:

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.  

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.  
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.  

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.   

Example 1:  

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"  
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"  
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]  

Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 105  
s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.

## Thought:
We use a hashmap and sliding window to do it. We start at the beginning of the string and check the substring starting from current letter
with 10 characters. If it is not a key, put it in and set the value as false. If it is and the value is false, add it into the result and set 
the value as true. Keep doing it until we finish the traversal.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<String> findRepeatedDnaSequences(String s) {
        Map<String, Boolean> map = new HashMap<>();
        int length = s.length();
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if(length <= 10) return result;
        for(int slow = 0; slow <= length - 10; slow++){
            String substring = s.substring(slow, slow + 10);
            if(map.containsKey(substring) && map.get(substring) == false){
                result.add(substring);
                map.put(substring, true);
            }
            else if(!map.containsKey(substring)){
                map.put(substring, false);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
