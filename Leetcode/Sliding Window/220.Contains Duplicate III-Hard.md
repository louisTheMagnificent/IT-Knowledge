## Question:

You are given an integer array nums and two integers indexDiff and valueDiff.  

Find a pair of indices (i, j) such that:  

i != j,  
abs(i - j) <= indexDiff.  
abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff, and  
Return true if such pair exists or false otherwise.   

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], indexDiff = 3, valueDiff = 0  
Output: true  

Explanation: We can choose (i, j) = (0, 3).  
We satisfy the three conditions:  
i != j --> 0 != 3  
abs(i - j) <= indexDiff --> abs(0 - 3) <= 3  
abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff --> abs(1 - 1) <= 0  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], indexDiff = 2, valueDiff = 3  
Output: false  

Explanation: After trying all the possible pairs (i, j), we cannot satisfy the three conditions, so we return false.  

Constraints:  

2 <= nums.length <= 105  
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109  
1 <= indexDiff <= nums.length  
0 <= valueDiff <= 109

## Thought: 
We use sliding window and the thought of bucket sorting to do it. This Java code is designed to solve the problem of finding if there are two distinct indices i and j in an array nums such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most valueDiff and the absolute difference between i and j is at most indexDiff. The solution uses a bucketing strategy where each number is assigned to a bucket based on its value divided by valueDiff + 1. This bucketing helps in reducing the range of numbers to be compared, simplifying the condition checks.
To handle negative numbers appropriately, the code adjusts the bucket ID by subtracting one if the number is negative. This adjustment ensures that negative numbers do not end up in the same bucket as positive numbers that they should not be compared with.
The code uses a hash map to store the most recent number of each bucket encountered as it iterates through the array. For each number, the algorithm checks the current bucket and its immediate neighbors (left and right buckets) to find any number within the specified valueDiff. If such a number is found, it immediately returns true indicating a nearby almost duplicate exists.
Additionally, the algorithm maintains a sliding window of size indexDiff to ensure that it only considers numbers within this range for potential duplicates. This is done by removing the bucket ID of the number that falls out of the sliding window from the hash map, which is calculated similarly by considering if the number is negative or positive.
This approach ensures efficient checking of conditions with reduced computational complexity compared to a naive solution that would require checking all possible pairs in the specified range.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(int[] nums, int indexDiff, int valueDiff) {
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            int id = 0;
            if(nums[i] < 0){
                id = nums[i] / (valueDiff + 1) - 1;
            }
            else{
                id = nums[i] / (valueDiff + 1);
            }

            if(map.containsKey(id) 
                || (map.containsKey(id - 1) && Math.abs(map.get(id - 1) - nums[i]) <= valueDiff) 
                || (map.containsKey(id + 1) && Math.abs(map.get(id + 1) - nums[i]) <= valueDiff)){
                    return true;
                }
            
            map.put(id, nums[i]);

            if(i >= indexDiff){
                int deleteID = nums[i - indexDiff] < 0 ? nums[i - indexDiff] / (valueDiff + 1) - 1 : nums[i - indexDiff] / (valueDiff + 1);
                map.remove(deleteID);
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
