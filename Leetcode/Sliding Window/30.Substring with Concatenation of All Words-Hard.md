## Question:

You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.  

A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.  

For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.  
Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.   

Example 1:  

Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]  

Output: [0,9]  

Explanation:  

The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.  
The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]  

Output: []  

Explanation:  

There is no concatenated substring.  

Example 3:  

Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]  

Output: [6,9,12]  

Explanation:  

The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"].  
The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"].  
The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"].   

Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 104  
1 <= words.length <= 5000  
1 <= words[i].length <= 30  
s and words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.

## Thought:
We use sliding window to do it. This Java code is a solution for the "Substring with Concatenation of All Words" problem, where the goal is to find all starting indices in the string s that are a concatenation of each word in the array words exactly once and without any intervening characters. Each word in the words array has the same length.  
The solution employs a sliding window technique combined with two hash maps: one (map) to store the frequency of each word in words and another (cache) to keep track of the words found within the current window in the string s. The sliding window is adjusted using two pointers, slow and fast, both of which start at an offset i, which varies from 0 to the length of a word minus one to cover all possible alignments of chunks in s that might be composed of the words from words.  
The approach iterates over s, extracting potential words using the getSubstring helper function, which simply wraps the substring method to fetch words of the specified length starting at the current fast pointer. If the extracted word is not in map, the window is reset; otherwise, the word's count in cache is incremented. If the count of the current word in cache exceeds its required frequency in map, the slow pointer is moved forward, decrementing the counts of the passed words to shrink the window until the frequencies match again.  
Once the length of the window matches the total length of all words in words combined, and the cache frequencies match those in map, the starting index at slow is added to the result list. The fast pointer continues moving forward by one word length until it reaches the end of s.   
This method ensures that all valid starting indices where the substring of s is a perfect concatenation of all the words in words are found and returned efficiently.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findSubstring(String s, String[] words) {
        int wordSize = words[0].length();
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if(s.length() < wordSize) return result;
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(String word : words){
            map.put(word, map.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < wordSize; i++){
            Map<String, Integer> cache = new HashMap<>();
            for(String j : words){
                cache.put(j, 0);
            }

            int fast = i;
            int slow = i;

            while(fast + wordSize <= s.length()){

                String curr = getSubstring(s, fast, wordSize);

                if(!map.containsKey(curr)){
                    cache.clear();
                    slow = fast + wordSize;
                    fast = slow;
                    continue;
                }

                cache.put(curr, cache.getOrDefault(curr, 0) + 1);

                while(cache.get(curr) > map.get(curr)){
                    String slowCurr = getSubstring(s, slow, wordSize);
                    cache.put(slowCurr, cache.get(slowCurr) - 1);
                    slow += wordSize;
                }

                if((fast - slow + wordSize == words[0].length() * words.length) && cache.equals(map)){
                    result.add(slow);
                }

                fast += wordSize;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    public String getSubstring(String s, int index, int wordSize){
        return s.substring(index, index + wordSize);
    }
}
```
Time complexity: (s.length() * words[0].length())  
Space complexity: (words.length)
