## Question:

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".  

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"  
Output: "BANC"  

Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "a", t = "a"  
Output: "a"  

Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.  

Example 3:  

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"  
Output: ""  

Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.  
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.  
 
Constraints:  

m == s.length  
n == t.length  
1 <= m, n <= 105  
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.   

Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

## Thought: 
This Java code implements the "Minimum Window Substring" problem, where the goal is to find the smallest substring in s that contains all the characters of t. The approach uses a sliding window technique combined with a hash map to efficiently check if the current window in s contains all characters required by t.  
The hash map initially stores the count of each character in t. A counter is set to the length of t to keep track of how many characters in the current window still need to be matched to have all characters from t.  
The outer loop expands the window by moving the fast pointer and checking each character of s. If the character is in t and its count is positive, the counter is decremented. The count of this character in the hash map is also decremented regardless of its count.  
Once the counter reaches zero, meaning the current window contains all characters from t, the inner while loop starts to shrink the window from the left. It moves the start pointer to the right until the window can no longer contain all characters from t. During this process, if the window size is smaller than the previously found window, it updates the minimum window size.  
After finding and updating the minimum window, the algorithm increments the count of the character at the start pointer to reflect its removal from the window, increments the counter, and moves the start pointer right, to attempt to find a new smaller window on subsequent iterations.  
If no valid window is found, the function returns an empty string; otherwise, it returns the substring corresponding to the minimum window found.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
        if(t.length() > s.length()) return "";

        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(char c : t.toCharArray()){
            if(!map.containsKey(c)){
                map.put(c, 1);
            }
            else{
                map.put(c, map.get(c) + 1);
            }
        }

        int counter = t.length();
        int start = 0;
        int[] window = {0, Integer.MAX_VALUE};

        for(int fast = 0; fast < s.length(); fast++){
            char curr = s.charAt(fast);

            if(map.containsKey(curr)){
                if(map.get(curr) > 0){
                    counter--;
                }
                map.put(curr, map.get(curr) - 1);
            }

            if(counter == 0){
                while(true){
                    char currStart = s.charAt(start);
                    if(map.containsKey(currStart)){
                        if(map.get(currStart) == 0) break;
                        else map.put(currStart, map.get(currStart) + 1);
                    } 
                    start++;
                }

                if(fast - start < window[1] - window[0]){
                    window[1] = fast;
                    window[0] = start;
                }

                map.put(s.charAt(start), map.get(s.charAt(start)) + 1);
                counter++;
                start++;
            }
        }

        return window[1] >= s.length() ? "" : s.substring(window[0], window[1] + 1);
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(s + t)  
Space complexity: O(t)
