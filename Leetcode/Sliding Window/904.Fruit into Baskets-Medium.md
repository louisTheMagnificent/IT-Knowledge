## Question:

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.  

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:  

You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.  
Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.  
Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.  
Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.  

Example 1:  

Input: fruits = [1,2,1]  
Output: 3  

Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.  

Example 2:  

Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]  
Output: 3  

Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].  
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].  

Example 3:  

Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]  
Output: 4  

Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].   
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].  

Constraints:  

1 <= fruits.length <= 105  
0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length

## Thought: 
We use Sliding Window and a hashmap to do it. This Java code defines a method, totalFruit, which finds the maximum number of fruits you can collect in a basket from a given list, with the constraint that you can only collect two different types of fruits. The method uses the sliding window technique along with a HashMap to keep track of the counts of each type of fruit within the current window.   
The slow and fast pointers are used to adjust the window's size: fast extends the window by adding fruits until a third type is encountered, and slow shrinks the window until only two types of fruits are left. The map is updated accordingly as fast and slow move, by adding new fruits or subtracting and potentially removing fruits that are no longer in the window. The maximum size of the window is tracked and returned as the result, representing the largest collection of fruits (up to two types) that can be achieved. This method ensures that all possible windows are considered by expanding and then contracting the window appropriately while updating the fruit counts and result optimally.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int totalFruit(int[] fruits) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int slow = 0;
        int fast = 0;
        int result = 0;
        while(fast < fruits.length){
            while(fast < fruits.length && map.size() < 3){
                map.put(fruits[fast], map.getOrDefault(fruits[fast], 0) + 1);
                if(map.size() == 3) break;
                fast++;
            }
            result = Math.max(result, fast - slow);
            if(fast == fruits.length) break;
            while(map.size() == 3){
                map.put(fruits[slow], map.get(fruits[slow]) - 1);
                if(map.get(fruits[slow]) == 0) map.remove(fruits[slow]);
                slow++;
            }
            fast++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
