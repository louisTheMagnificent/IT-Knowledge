## Question:

You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.  

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.  

Note that:  

The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.  
Each operand may be an integer or another expression.  
The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.  
There will not be any division by zero.  
The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.  
The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.  
 
Example 1:  

Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]  
Output: 9  

Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9  

Example 2:  

Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]  
Output: 6  

Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6  

Example 3:  

Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]  
Output: 22  

Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5  
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5  
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5  
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5  
= (0 + 17) + 5  
= 17 + 5  
= 22  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= tokens.length <= 104  
tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].

## Thought: 
We use a stack to do it. We traverse the array. If the current string is a number, add it into the stack. If not, get the two numbers from 
the stack and do the calculation. Then add the result into the stack. After the traversal, the peek element is the result.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {
    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        set.add("+");
        set.add("-");
        set.add("*");
        set.add("/");
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++){
            String curr = tokens[i];
            if(!set.contains(curr)){
                int num = Integer.parseInt(curr);
                stack.add(num);
            }
            else{
                int num1 = stack.pop();
                int num2 = stack.pop();
                int result = 0;
                if(curr.equals("+")) result = num1 + num2;
                else if(curr.equals("*")) result = num1 * num2;
                else if(curr.equals("-")) result = num2 - num1;
                else result = num2 / num1;
                stack.add(result);
            }
        }
        return stack.peek();
    }
}
```
