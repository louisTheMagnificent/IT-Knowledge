## Question: 

Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.  

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().  
 
Example 1:  

Input: s = "1 + 1"  
Output: 2  

Example 2:  

Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "  
Output: 3  

Example 3:  

Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"  
Output: 23  

Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105  
s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.  
s represents a valid expression.  
'+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).  
'-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).  
There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.  
Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

## Thought:

This Java code implements a calculator that processes arithmetic expressions containing digits, plus ('+'), minus ('-'), parentheses ('(' and ')'), and spaces. The purpose of the code is to evaluate the expression and return the result as an integer. Here's a brief overview of the design and logic of the code:  
Stack Usage: A Stack<String> is utilized to manage the arithmetic operators, parentheses, and numbers as strings. The stack helps in evaluating the expression following the correct order of operations, particularly handling parentheses.  
Main Calculation Loop: The code iterates through the input string s character by character. Spaces are skipped to focus on meaningful characters that affect the calculation (digits, operators, and parentheses).  
Character Handling:  
Operators and Parentheses: When encountering a '+', '-', or '(', the character is converted to a string and pushed onto the stack. This sets up for handling the next part of the expression.  
Closing Parenthesis (')'): When a ')' is found, the code pops the top of the stack to get the number inside the parentheses, pops again to discard the '(' (assuming well-formed expressions), and then performs a calculation to integrate this number into the ongoing result.  
Numbers: Numbers are built by reading consecutive digits and transforming them into a single integer. This number is then passed to a calculation function to be integrated into the current state of the expression based on the previous operators.  
Calculation Function (calculation): This method manages the arithmetic based on the context provided by the stack:  
If the stack is empty or the top is '(', the number is directly pushed onto the stack.  
If the top of the stack is an operator ('+' or '-'), the operator is popped, and the previous number is also popped from the stack to perform the specified arithmetic operation with the current number. The result is then pushed back onto the stack.  
Final Result: After processing all characters in the string, the final result of the expression is found at the top of the stack and is returned after converting it to an integer.  
This implementation directly manipulates a stack to handle operators and operands efficiently, ensuring that operations are carried out in the correct order, especially with respect to parentheses in the input string. The code effectively uses basic control structures and stack operations to parse and evaluate the given arithmetic expression.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {

    Stack<String> stack;

    public int calculate(String s){
        stack = new Stack<>();
        int n = s.length();
        int i = 0;
        while(i < n){
            if(s.charAt(i) == ' '){
                i++;
                continue;
            }
            else if(s.charAt(i) == '+' || s.charAt(i) == '(' || s.charAt(i) == '-'){
                stack.add(Character.toString(s.charAt(i)));
                i++;
            }
            else if(s.charAt(i) == ')'){
                String num = stack.pop();
                stack.pop();
                calculation(num);
                i++;
            }
            else{
                int j = i;
                int currnum = 0;
                while(j < n && s.charAt(j) != '-' && s.charAt(j) != '+' && s.charAt(j) != ')'){
                    if(s.charAt(j) == ' '){
                        j++;
                        continue;
                    }
                    currnum = currnum * 10 + Character.getNumericValue(s.charAt(j));
                    j++;
                }
                calculation(Integer.toString(currnum));
                i = j;
            }
        }
        return Integer.parseInt(stack.peek());
    }

    public void calculation(String num){
        if(stack.isEmpty() || stack.peek().equals("(")){
            stack.add(num);
        }
        else{
            int curr = Integer.parseInt(num);
            if(stack.peek().equals("+")){
                stack.pop();
                int prev = Integer.parseInt(stack.pop());
                int result = prev + curr;
                stack.add(Integer.toString(result));
            }
            else{
                stack.pop();
                if(stack.isEmpty() || stack.peek().equals("(")){
                    curr = 0 - curr;
                    stack.add(Integer.toString(curr));
                }
                else{
                    int prev = Integer.parseInt(stack.pop());
                    int result = prev - curr;
                    stack.add(Integer.toString(result));
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
