## Question:

Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring. 

Example 1:  

Input: s = "(()"  
Output: 2  

Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()".  

Example 2:  

Input: s = ")()())"  
Output: 4  

Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".  

Example 3:  

Input: s = ""  
Output: 0  

Constraints:  

0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104  
s[i] is '(', or ')'.

## Thought:
We use stack to do it. 
This Java code implements a solution to find the length of the longest valid parentheses substring within a given string s. It uses a stack to track indices of characters in the string, initializing with -1 to handle edge cases effectively. For each character in the string:  
If it's an opening parenthesis '(', its index is pushed onto the stack as a potential start of a valid substring.  
If it's a closing parenthesis ')', the top of the stack is popped. If this pop empties the stack, the current index is pushed to indicate the position of a right parenthesis that doesn't have a matching left parenthesis. If the stack is not empty after popping, the length of the current valid substring is calculated as the difference between the current index and the new top of the stack. The maximum of these lengths is updated accordingly.  
The approach effectively tracks the starting index of potential valid substrings, updating the longest found as it processes each parenthesis in the string.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {
    public int longestValidParentheses(String s) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(-1);
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            if(s.charAt(i) == '('){
                stack.push(i);
            }
            else{
                stack.pop();
                if(stack.isEmpty()){
                    stack.push(i);
                }
                else{
                    result = Math.max(result, i - stack.peek());
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
