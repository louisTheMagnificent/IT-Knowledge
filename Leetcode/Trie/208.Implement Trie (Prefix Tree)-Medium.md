## Question:

A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.  

Implement the Trie class:  

Trie() Initializes the trie object.  
void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.  
boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.  
boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.  

Example 1:  

Input  
["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]  
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]  

Output  
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]   

Explanation  
Trie trie = new Trie();  
trie.insert("apple");  
trie.search("apple");   // return True  
trie.search("app");     // return False  
trie.startsWith("app"); // return True  
trie.insert("app");  
trie.search("app");     // return True  

Constraints:  

1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000  
word and prefix consist only of lowercase English letters.  
At most 3 * 104 calls in total will be made to insert, search, and startsWith.

## Thought:

This Java code defines a Trie data structure that is typically used for efficient storage and retrieval of strings, especially in scenarios involving prefix lookups and spell checking. Here's a brief explanation of the design and functionality:  

Class Definitions:  

TrieNode Class:  
The TrieNode class encapsulates the behavior and properties of each node within the Trie. Each node contains:  
val: A character value that the node represents.  
isWord: A boolean flag indicating whether the node marks the end of a word.  
children: An array of TrieNode references, each corresponding to one of the 26 English lowercase letters.  
There are two constructors: one for initializing a node with a specific character and one default constructor for creating a root node with no character value.  

Trie Class:  
The Trie class manages the overall operations of the Trie data structure. It includes:  
root: A TrieNode that acts as the starting point of the Trie.  
Methods for inserting words, searching for words, and checking for the presence of a prefix in the Trie.  

Methods:  
insert(String word):  
Iterates over each character in the word.  
Checks if a child node corresponding to the character exists; if not, creates a new node.  
Moves to the child node and repeats until all characters are processed.  
Marks the last node as the end of a word (isWord = true).  

search(String word):  
Traverses the Trie according to the characters of the word.  
If any character node is missing before the word is fully traversed, returns false.  
Checks the isWord flag of the last node to determine if the entire word, not just a prefix, is present.  

startsWith(String prefix):  
Similar to search but only checks for the presence of nodes corresponding to each character in the prefix.  
Returns true if the entire prefix is found, regardless of the isWord status.  

Summary:  
The Trie implementation efficiently handles insertions, full word searches, and prefix checks using a character-based tree structure. Each node in the Trie can potentially have up to 26 children, one for each letter of the alphabet, allowing operations to be performed in 
O(L) time complexity, where L is the length of the string being inserted or searched. This makes the Trie particularly suited for applications involving a large number of string operations, such as autocomplete features and dictionary implementations.

## Solution:
```Java
class TrieNode{
    public char val;
    public boolean isWord;
    public TrieNode[] children;
    
    public TrieNode(char c){
        this.val = c;
        this.children = new TrieNode[26];
        this.isWord = false;
    }

    public TrieNode() {
        this.children = new TrieNode[26];
        this.isWord = false;
    }
}


class Trie {

    private TrieNode root;
    public Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    public void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode curr = root;
        for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++){
            char c = word.charAt(i);
            if(curr.children[c - 'a'] == null){
                curr.children[c - 'a'] = new TrieNode(c);
            }
            curr = curr.children[c - 'a'];
        }
        curr.isWord = true;
    }
    
    public boolean search(String word) {
        TrieNode curr = root;
        for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++){
            char c = word.charAt(i);
            if(curr.children[c - 'a'] == null) return false;
            else curr = curr.children[c - 'a'];
        }
        return curr.isWord;
    }
    
    public boolean startsWith(String prefix) {
        TrieNode curr = root;
        for(int i = 0; i < prefix.length(); i++){
            char c = prefix.charAt(i);
            if(curr.children[c - 'a'] == null) return false;
            else curr = curr.children[c - 'a'];
        }
        return true;
    }
}

/**
 * Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Trie obj = new Trie();
 * obj.insert(word);
 * boolean param_2 = obj.search(word);
 * boolean param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix);
 */
```
Time complexity: O(length)
Space complexity: O(longest length)
