## Question:

Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.  

Implement the WordDictionary class:  

WordDictionary() Initializes the object.  
void addWord(word) Adds word to the data structure, it can be matched later.  
bool search(word) Returns true if there is any string in the data structure that matches word or false otherwise. word may contain dots '.' where dots can be matched with any letter.  

Example:  

Input  
["WordDictionary","addWord","addWord","addWord","search","search","search","search"]  
[[],["bad"],["dad"],["mad"],["pad"],["bad"],[".ad"],["b.."]]  

Output
[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true]  

Explanation  
WordDictionary wordDictionary = new WordDictionary();  
wordDictionary.addWord("bad");  
wordDictionary.addWord("dad");  
wordDictionary.addWord("mad");  
wordDictionary.search("pad"); // return False  
wordDictionary.search("bad"); // return True  
wordDictionary.search(".ad"); // return True  
wordDictionary.search("b.."); // return True  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= word.length <= 25  
word in addWord consists of lowercase English letters.  
word in search consist of '.' or lowercase English letters.  
There will be at most 2 dots in word for search queries.

## Thought:
We use trie to do it.

This Java code implements a WordDictionary class that functions similarly to a Trie (prefix tree), but with support for searching words with wildcard characters represented by '.'. Here's a brief overview of the design and functionalities:  

Class Structure:  
WordDictionary Class:  

Fields:  
trieArray: An array of WordDictionary objects representing children nodes for each character from 'a' to 'z'.  
isWord: A boolean flag indicating whether the node marks the end of a valid word.  

Constructor:  
Initializes the trieArray with null values and sets isWord to false.  

Methods:  

addWord(String word):  
Iteratively builds the Trie structure for a given word.  
Starts from the root (this) and for each character in the word, moves to the corresponding child node or creates a new WordDictionary node if it doesn't exist.  
Marks the node corresponding to the last character of the word as the end of a word (isWord = true).  

search(String word):  
Recursively searches for a word in the Trie, with support for wildcard characters ('.').  
If the current character is a dot ('.'), it iterates over all possible children. If any child leads to a successful match for the rest of the word (starting from the next character), it returns true.  
If the current character is not a dot, it directly navigates to the corresponding child node. If the node doesn't exist, it returns false.  
After processing all characters, checks the isWord flag to determine if the entire word, not just a prefix, was found.  

Summary:  
The WordDictionary class is a specialized Trie implementation that supports adding words and searching for words including wildcard searches. It efficiently manages word storage and retrieval, enabling fast lookup times for standard and wildcard searches by leveraging the Trie structure. This design is particularly useful in applications requiring frequent insertions and flexible queries, such as word games or in implementations of complex search functionalities in text-based data.

## Solution:
```Java
class WordDictionary {

    private WordDictionary[] trieArray;
    private boolean isWord;
    public WordDictionary() {
        this.trieArray = new WordDictionary[26];
        this.isWord = false;
    }
    
    public void addWord(String word) {
        WordDictionary curr = this;
        for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++){
            char c = word.charAt(i);
            if(curr.trieArray[c - 'a'] == null){
                curr.trieArray[c - 'a'] = new WordDictionary();
            }
            curr = curr.trieArray[c - 'a'];
        }
        curr.isWord = true;
        return;
    }
    
    public boolean search(String word) {
        WordDictionary curr = this;
        for(int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++){
            char c = word.charAt(i);
            if(c == '.'){
                for(WordDictionary ch : curr.trieArray){
                    if(ch != null && ch.search(word.substring(i + 1))) return true; 
                }
                return false;
            }            
            if(curr.trieArray[c - 'a'] == null) return false;
            curr = curr.trieArray[c - 'a'];            
        }
        return curr.isWord;
    }
}

/**
 * Your WordDictionary object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * WordDictionary obj = new WordDictionary();
 * obj.addWord(word);
 * boolean param_2 = obj.search(word);
 */
```
Time complexity: O(length)  
Space complexity: O(length)
At most 104 calls will be made to addWord and search.
