## Question:

Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.  

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.  

Example 1:  

Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]  
Output: ["eat","oath"]  

Example 2:  

Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]  
Output: []  
 
Constraints:  

m == board.length  
n == board[i].length  
1 <= m, n <= 12  
board[i][j] is a lowercase English letter.  
1 <= words.length <= 3 * 104  
1 <= words[i].length <= 10  
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.  
All the strings of words are unique.

## Thought:
We use backtrack and trie to do it.

This Java code implements a solution to find all unique words that can be formed by traversing a 2D character board, where each word must match one of the provided strings in an array. The method utilizes a Trie data structure for efficient word matching and a backtracking algorithm for exploring possible paths on the board.  

Trie Construction: The code begins by building a Trie from the array of words. Each word is inserted into the Trie, where each character of a word corresponds to a node in the Trie. If a node for a specific character doesn't exist, it is created. The end of each word is marked by storing the word at the node corresponding to the last character of the word.  

Backtracking Function: The main functionality of finding words is implemented in the backtrack method, which explores the board starting from every cell. The method checks each cell's character, updating the path if the character exists in the children of the current Trie node. If a node marks the end of a word (i.e., node.word is not null), the word is added to a result set to ensure uniqueness.  

Boundary Checks and Marker: During the traversal, the method uses boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds access and marks cells that have been visited by replacing the character with a '#' to avoid revisiting during the current path. After the recursive call, the cell is restored to its original character.  

Result Compilation: After all possible paths are explored, the words found are returned as a list derived from the result set, ensuring that each word is only listed once despite potentially being found through different paths on the board.  

The combination of Trie for fast prefix matching and backtracking for exploring all possible paths makes this approach effective for solving word search problems on a board.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<String> findWords(char[][] board, String[] words) {
        Set<String> result = new HashSet<>();
        TrieNode root = buildTrie(words);
        for(int i = 0; i < board.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++){
                backtrack(board, i, j, root, result, 0);
            }
        }

        return new ArrayList<>(result);
    }

    public void backtrack(char[][] board, int i, int j, TrieNode root, Set<String> result, int currLength){
        if(i < 0 || i >= board.length || j < 0 || j >= board[0].length || 
            board[i][j] == '#' || root.children[board[i][j] - 'a'] == null || currLength > 9) {
            return;
        }

        if(root.children[board[i][j] - 'a'].word != null){
            result.add(root.children[board[i][j] - 'a'].word);
        }

        root = root.children[board[i][j] - 'a'];
        char c = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = '#';
        backtrack(board, i + 1, j, root, result, currLength + 1);
        backtrack(board, i - 1, j, root, result, currLength + 1);
        backtrack(board, i, j - 1, root, result, currLength + 1);
        backtrack(board, i, j + 1, root, result, currLength + 1);
        board[i][j] = c;
        return;
    }

    public TrieNode buildTrie(String words[]){
        TrieNode root = new TrieNode();
        for(String s : words){
            TrieNode curr = root;
            for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
                char c = s.charAt(i);
                if(curr.children[c - 'a'] == null) curr.children[c - 'a'] = new TrieNode();
                curr = curr.children[c - 'a'];
            }
            curr.word = s;
        }

        return root;
    }
}

class TrieNode{
    protected TrieNode[] children;
    protected String word;

    public TrieNode(){
        this.children = new TrieNode[26];
        this.word = null;
    }
}
