## Question:

Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.  

Return the sum of the three integers.  

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.  

Example 1:  

Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1   
Output: 2  
 
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1  
Output: 0  

Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).  

Constraints:  

3 <= nums.length <= 500  
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000  
-104 <= target <= 104

## Thought:
We use two pointers to do it.

This Java code provides a solution to find the sum of three integers in an array that is closest to a given target. The approach leverages sorting and a two-pointer technique to efficiently find the optimal sum. Here's a concise overview of the solution's logic:  

Sort the Array:  
The input array nums is first sorted. Sorting the array allows the use of a two-pointer approach to efficiently explore potential sums.  

Initialize Variables:  
closest is initialized to a very large value (Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2) to ensure that any initial comparison will update closest.  
front is initialized but not used in the provided snippet.  

Iterate Through the Array:  
A for-loop is used where i serves as the index for the first element of the triplet. The loop runs until nums.length - 2 to leave room for the other two elements of the triplet.  

Two-Pointer Search:  
Inside the loop, two pointers left and right are initialized for each i. left starts just after i, and right starts at the end of the array.  
The while loop is used to move left and right based on the sum of nums[i], nums[left], and nums[right] compared to target.  
If the sum is greater than the target, decrement right to try a smaller sum.  
If the sum is less than the target, increment left to try a larger sum.  
If the sum exactly equals the target, it is the closest possible sum, and it is returned immediately.  

Update Closest Sum:  
During each iteration of the while loop, if the absolute difference between the current sum and the target is less than the absolute difference between closest and the target, update closest to this current sum.  

Return the Result:  
After completing the iterations, the closest sum found is returned as the result.  

This method efficiently finds the closest sum by sorting the array and then narrowing down the possible sums using a two-pointer approach, reducing the need for a more computationally expensive three-nested-loop solution.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int front = 0;
        int closest = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++){
            int left = i + 1;
            int right = nums.length - 1;
            while(left < right){
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[right] + nums[left];
                if(Math.abs(sum - target) < Math.abs(closest - target)){
                    closest = sum;
                }
                if(sum > target) right--;
                else if(sum < target) left++;
                else return sum;
            }
        }

        return closest;
    }
}
```
