## Question:

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.  

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]  
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]   

Example 2:  

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]  
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 105  
s[i] is a printable ascii character.  

---
## Thought:
We use two pointers to do it. The front one points at the front and the back one points at the end. We keep switching front char and back 
char until front >= back.

---
## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int front = 0;
        int back = s.length - 1;
        while(front < back){
            char c = s[back];
            s[back] = s[front];
            s[front] = c;
            front++;
            back--;
        }
        return;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)
