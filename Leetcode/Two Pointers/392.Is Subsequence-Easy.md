## Question:

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.  

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"  
Output: true  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"  
Output: false
 
Constraints:  

0 <= s.length <= 100  
0 <= t.length <= 104  
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.   

Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Thought 1:
We use two pointers to do it. We start at the first characters of both string. If the current characters are the same, both move forward. Else only move t's pointer. 
We do it until one string finishes traversing. If the one is substring, return true. Else return false.

## Solution 1:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        if(s.length() > t.length()) return false;

        int sPointer = 0;
        int tPointer = 0;
        while(sPointer < s.length() && tPointer < t.length()){
            if(s.charAt(sPointer) == t.charAt(tPointer)){
                sPointer++;
            }
            tPointer++;
        }

        return sPointer == s.length();
    }
}
```

## Thought 2:
We use md dp to do it.

This Java code determines if string s is a subsequence of string t using dynamic programming. It utilizes a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest subsequence of the first i characters of s and the first j characters of t. The algorithm iterates through each character of s and t, updating the dp array based on character matches. If characters match (s.charAt(i - 1) == t.charAt(j - 1)), it increments the value from the top-left diagonal (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1); if not, it carries the value from the left (dp[i][j - 1]). After filling the dp array, the code checks if the last value in dp (dp[s.length()][t.length()]) equals the length of s, which confirms if s is a subsequence of t.

## Solution 2:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s.length() + 1][t.length() + 1];
        
        for(int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= t.length(); j++){
                if(s.charAt(i - 1) == t.charAt(j - 1)) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                else dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }

        return s.length() == dp[s.length()][t.length()];
    }
}
```

## Thought 3:
We use md dp to do it but only 1d array.

This Java code checks if string s is a subsequence of string t using a space-optimized dynamic programming approach. Instead of a 2D array, it uses a 1D array dp where dp[j] keeps track of the length of the longest subsequence of s and the first j characters of t. The code iterates over each character of s and then over each character of t, updating the dp array accordingly. During each character comparison, it checks if the current characters of s and t match. If they do, it increments the longest subsequence length found up to the previous character (prev + 1); otherwise, it keeps the length from the previous t character (dp[j - 1]). The prev variable temporarily stores dp[j] before it's updated to facilitate the correct transfer of values. The final check compares if the length of s matches the last value in dp, which indicates whether s is a complete subsequence of t.

## Solution 3:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int[] dp = new int[t.length() + 1];
        
        for(int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++){
            int prev = dp[0];
            for(int j = 1; j <= t.length(); j++){
                int temp = dp[j];
                if(s.charAt(i - 1) == t.charAt(j - 1)) dp[j] = prev + 1;
                else dp[j] = dp[j - 1];
                prev = temp;
            }
        }

        return s.length() == dp[t.length()];
    }
}
```
