## Question:

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.  

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"  
Output: true  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"  
Output: false
 
Constraints:  

0 <= s.length <= 100  
0 <= t.length <= 104  
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.   

Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Thought:
We use two pointers to do it. We start at the first characters of both string. If the current characters are the same, both move forward. Else only move t's pointer. 
We do it until one string finishes traversing. If the one is substring, return true. Else return false.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        if(s.length() > t.length()) return false;

        int sPointer = 0;
        int tPointer = 0;
        while(sPointer < s.length() && tPointer < t.length()){
            if(s.charAt(sPointer) == t.charAt(tPointer)){
                sPointer++;
            }
            tPointer++;
        }

        return sPointer == s.length();
    }
}
```
