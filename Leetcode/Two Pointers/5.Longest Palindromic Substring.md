## Question:

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Example 1:  

Input: s = "babad"  
Output: "bab"  

Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "cbbd"  
Output: "bb"  

Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 1000  
s consist of only digits and English letters.

## Thought:
We use two pointers to do it. The longestPalindrome algorithm in Java identifies the longest palindromic substring by expanding around each character and each pair of consecutive characters to cover both odd and even length palindromes. It uses a helper function, expandAroundCenter, to check for palindromes by comparing characters symmetrically around these centers until they no longer match. The algorithm updates the longest palindrome dynamically and returns it after iterating through all potential centers.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        if(s == null || s.length() < 1) return "";
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            int len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);
            int len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);
            int len = Math.max(len1, len2);
            if(len > (end - start)){
                start = i - (len - 1) / 2;
                end = i + len / 2;
            }
        }
        return s.substring(start, end + 1);
    }

    private int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right){
        while(left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)){
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return right - left - 1;
    }
}
```
