## Question:

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.  

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2  
Output: "bacdfeg"  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2  
Output: "bacd"  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 104  
s consists of only lowercase English letters.  
1 <= k <= 104

## Thought: 
We use two pointers to do it. We divide the string into each groups with 2k size. We deal with each group and we deal the last group which is an 
edge case.

## Solution: 
```Java
class Solution {
    public String reverseStr(String s, int k) {
        if(k == 1) return s;
        int loop = s.length() / (k * 2);
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        int i = 0;
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        for(; i < loop; i++){
            start = 2 * k * i;
            end = start + k - 1;
            switchChar(chars, start, end);
        }
        start = 2 * k * i;
        if(start != chars.length && chars.length - start <= k){
            end = chars.length - 1;
            switchChar(chars, start, end);
        }
        else if(start != chars.length && chars.length - start > k){
            end = start + k - 1;
            switchChar(chars, start, end);
        }

        return new String(chars);
    }

    public void switchChar(char[] chars, int start, int end){
        while(start < end){
            char c = chars[end];
            chars[end] = chars[start];
            chars[start] = c;
            start++;
            end--;                
        }
        return;
    }
}
```
