## Question:

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.  

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.  

Example 1:  

Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"  
Output: true  

Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".  

Example 2:  

Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"  
Output: true  

Explanation: Both s and t become "".  

Example 3:  

Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"  
Output: false  

Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200  
s and t only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.  
 
Follow up: Can you solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

## Thought: 
We use two pointers to help us to do it. This Java code defines a method, backspaceCompare, that compares two strings, s and t, to determine if they are equal after processing backspaces represented by the # character. The method utilizes a two-pointer approach, with each pointer starting at the end of the respective strings and moving backwards. It handles the backspaces by using a helper method, dealString, which calculates the new position of the pointer after all consecutive backspaces and any characters that should be removed are accounted for.  
When comparing characters from s and t, if a backspace is encountered in either string, dealString is called to adjust the pointer position to the next valid character. If the characters at the current positions are the same, both pointers are moved backward. If they differ, the method returns false, indicating the strings do not match after processing backspaces.  
After the main comparison loop, if there are remaining backspaces in either string, dealString is used again to ensure both pointers are at valid positions or at the start of the strings. The method finally returns true if both pointers are at the same position, implying the processed strings are identical, and false otherwise.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean backspaceCompare(String s, String t) {
        int sPointer = s.length() - 1;
        int tPointer = t.length() - 1;
        while(sPointer >= 0 && tPointer >= 0){
            
            if(s.charAt(sPointer) == '#'){
                sPointer = dealString(s, sPointer);
            }

            if(t.charAt(tPointer) == '#'){
                tPointer = dealString(t, tPointer);
            }

            if(sPointer < 0 || tPointer < 0) break;
            
            if(s.charAt(sPointer) == t.charAt(tPointer)){
                sPointer--;
                tPointer--;
            }
            else{
                return false;
            }
        }
        if(sPointer >= 0 && s.charAt(sPointer) == '#') sPointer = dealString(s, sPointer);
        if(tPointer >= 0 && t.charAt(tPointer) == '#') tPointer = dealString(t, tPointer);
        return sPointer == tPointer ? true : false;
    }

    public int dealString(String s, int pointer){
        while(pointer >= 0 && s.charAt(pointer) == '#'){
            int counter = 0;
            int curr = pointer;
            while(curr >= 0 && s.charAt(curr) == '#'){
                counter++;
                curr--;
            }
            if(curr == -1) return -1;
            pointer = curr;
            int step = 0;
            while(pointer >= 0 && step < counter){
                if(s.charAt(pointer) == '#'){
                    counter += 2;
                }
                step++;
                pointer--;
            }
            if(pointer < 0) break;
        }

        return pointer < 0 ? -1 : pointer;
    }
}
```
