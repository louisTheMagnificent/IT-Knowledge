## Question:

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.  

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]  
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]  

Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].  
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].  

Example 2:  

Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]  
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]  
 
Constraints:  

1 <= nums.length <= 104  
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104  
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.  
 
Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?

## Thought: 
We use two pointers to do it. One points at the end and one points at the start.

## Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] nums) {
        int front = 0;
        int back = nums.length - 1;
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        int pointer = nums.length - 1;
        while(front <= back){
            int frontNum = nums[front] * nums[front];
            int backNum = nums[back] * nums[back];
            if(frontNum >= backNum){
                result[pointer] = frontNum;
                front++;
            }
            else{
                result[pointer] = backNum;
                back--;
            }
            pointer--;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n) (count the result)
